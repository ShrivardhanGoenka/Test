Datasheet | intelligent Business Gateways AT-iBG910 ADSL Business Gateway with Analog and Digital VoIP Ports AT-iBG910A/B 1 x annex A/B ADSL2+, 8 x 10/100TX, 4 x FXS, 2 x ISDN BRI Broadband Business Gateway for Small-Medium Enterprise The AT-iBG910 is the family of Business Gateways for small-medium enterprise applications.The AT-iBG910 combines a broadband ADSL2/2+ connection to the WAN with Layer 3 capabilities and enhanced VoIP features set for both analog and digital terminal connections. Voice over IP The AT-iBG910 leverages Voice over IP signaling protocols such as H.323, SIP and MGCP on both FXS and ISDN BRI interfaces.VoIP interoperability has been established with major softswitch vendors. Furthermore, the AT-iBG910 allows the connection of modems and faxes to its voice ports. Quality of Service is provided through mechanisms such as the Type of Service (ToS), priority tagging of voice traffic using IEEE 802.1p, as well as silence suppression and local generation of comfort noise; the result is an excellent voice quality. Within a SIP environment, the AT-iBG910 also supports IP PBX functionality that guarantees local switching of calls among FXS and ISDN BRI interfaces as well as VoIP phones connected to the LAN even when central VoIP service is not available. Allied Telesis www.alliedtelesis.com Real Time Applications Optimization The AT-iBG910 supports industry leading Quality of Service (QoS) through ISO Layer 2 and 3 prioritization techniques including priority tagging with IEEE 802.1p,Type of Service and DSCP fields. The AT-iBG910 is optimized for IP video streaming.The iBG ‘snoops’ IGMP packets in- transit allowing simultaneous delivery of different multicast transmissions such as different movies or TV channels.This enables multiple high-quality, high bit-rate video streams without impacting data traffic or IP telephony while delivering the fast channel change that users expect from video services. MPEG video service management and diagnosis is possible through dedicated commands and video quality can be monitored using Allied Telesis’ unique MPEG stream monitoring tool. Data Delivery and Security The extensive support for per port rate-limiting in the AT-iBG910 enables service providers to deliver tiered data services for the wide spectrum of end-customer profiles, providing maximum flexibility in service differentiation. Security is assured by an integral Stateful Inspection Firewall with NAT and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to protect end-users’ networks from Denial of Service (DoS), port scanning and Web spoofing. Management and Deployment The AT-iBG910 is designed to be easy to deploy and manage.With the Zero Touch Configurator (ZTC) software platform, this family of products can be remotely provisioned and managed. ZTC is a distributed configuration system providing secure authentication and registration plus intelligent, automatic configuration of remote iBG units. Its XML- based structure enables seamless integration with service providers’ existing OSS platforms. In addition, the industry standard TR-069 is fully integrated and provides efficient, scalable and secure provisioning and support for a wide variety of Triple Play services.
