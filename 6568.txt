When you use data encryption, data transferred by radio signals in the air will become unreadable for those people who don’t know correct encryption key (encryption password). There are two ways to set wireless security: 1. Click ‘Security’ on the left of web management interface.  34
2. Click ‘Set Security’ button when the wireless operating mode you selected is ‘AP Bridge-Point to Point’, ‘AP Bridge-Point to Multi-Point’, or ‘AP Bridge-WDS’. There are four types of security level you can select: Disable (no security - data encryption disabled), WEP, WPA Pre-shared Key, and WPA Radius. Please refer to the following sections for detailed instructions. Please remember it’s very important to set wireless security settings properly! Without a proper setting, hackers and intruders may gain access to your local network and do something bad to your computers and servers, which could cause serious problem. There are several things you can do to improve wireless security: 1. Always enable data encryption. Only disable it when you want to open your wireless access point to the public. 2. Never use simple words as encryption password. Use the random combination of symbols, numbers, and alphabets will greatly improve security. 3. Use WPA when possible - it's much safer than WEP. 4. Change encryption password when you’ve used it for too long time. NOTE: If you have enabled Multiple SSID function, please select the SSID network you wish to configure in advance. 2.5.1 WEP WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a common encryption mode, it’s safe enough for home and personal use. But if you need higher level of security, please consider using WPA encryption (see next Section). However, some wireless clients don’t support WPA, but only support WEP, so WEP is still a good choice for you if you have such kind of client in your network environment. When you select ‘WEP’ as encryption type, the following page will be displayed:  35
Here are descriptions of every setup item: Key Length There are two types of WEP key length: 64-bit and 128-bit. Using ‘128-bit’ is safer than ’64-bit’, but will reduce some data transfer performance. Key Format There are two types of key format: ASCII and Hex. When you select a key format, the number of characters of key will be displayed. For example, if you select ’64-bit’ as key length, and ‘Hex’ as key format, you’ll see the message at the right of ‘Key Format’ is ‘Hex (10 characters), which means the length of WEP key is 10 characters. Default Tx Key You can set up to four sets of WEP key, and you can decide which key is being used by default here. If you don’t know which one you should use, select ‘Key 1’. Encryption Key 1 to 4 Input WEP key characters here, the number of characters must be the same as the number displayed at ‘Key Format’ field. You can use any alphanumerical characters (0-9, a-z, and A-Z) if you select ‘ASCII’ key format, and if you select ‘Hex’ as key format, you can use characters 0-9, a-f, and A-F. You must enter at least one encryption key here, and if you entered multiple WEP keys, they should not be same with each other. Enable 802.1x Check this box to enable 802.1x user authentication. Please refer to Authentication Section 2-7-5 for detailed instructions.  36
2.5.2 WPA Pre-Shared Key WPA Pre-Shared key is the safest encryption method currently, and it’s recommended to use this encryption method to ensure the safety of your data.

Suite It is suggested to select WPA2 (AES) but you have to make sure your wireless clients support the cipher you selected. WPA2 Mixed supports both WPA and WPA2. If some of your wireless client supports WPA but not WPA2, you can select this cipher. Pre-shared Key Please select the format of pre-shared key here, available options Format are ‘Passphrase’ (8 to 63 alphanumerical characters) and ‘Hex (64 hexadecimal characters – 0 to 9 and a to f). Pre-shared Key Please input a key value according to the key format you selected here. For security reason, don’t use simple words). 2.5.3 WPA Radius WPA Radius is the combination of WPA encryption method and RADIUS user authentication. If you have a RADIUS authentication server, you can check the identity of every wireless client by user database. When you select ‘WPA RADIUS’ as encryption type, the following page will be displayed:  37
Here are descriptions of every setup item: WPA Unicast Cipher You can select WPA encryption type here. AES is safer than TKIP, Suite but not every wireless client supports it.
