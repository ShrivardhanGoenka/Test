Inspect the unit visually for damage due to shipping and report all such claims immediately to the carrier involved. Note that each unit should have the following: - AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller - Warranty Card - Operator’s Manual - Release certification Verify that all items are present before proceeding and report any shortage immediately to your supplier. 2.2.1 Warranty Complete the warranty card information and send it to NAT when the installation is complete. If you fail to complete the warranty card, the warranty will be activated on date of shipment from NAT. Note : An appropriately rated facility, e.g. Certified Aircraft Repair Station, must install this equipment in accordance with applicable regulations. NAT Ltd’s warranty is not valid unless the equipment is installed by an authorized NAT Dealer. Failure to follow any of the installation instructions, or installation by a non-certified individual or agency will void the warranty, and may result in a non-airworthy installation. 2.3 Installation Procedures 2.3.1 Warnings Do not bundle any lines from this unit with transmitter coax lines. Do not bundle any audio or DC power lines from this unit with 400 Hz synchro wiring or AC power lines. Do not position this unit or wiring from this unit next to any device with a strong alternating magnetic field such as an inverter, or significant audio interference will result. Oct 13, 2005 Page 2-1 ENG-FORM: 805-0106.DOT CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY TO NORTHERN AIRBORNE TECHNOLOGY LTD. Section 2 Installation
AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller Manual SM69 Rev. 4.00 2.3.2 Cautions In all installations, use shielded cable exactly as shown and ground as indicated. Significant ground loop and noise problems may result from not following these guidelines. The shielding and routing of the MIC and ICS TIE LINES used in the AA12S installation is very critical and poor performance of the aircraft audio system will result if these issues are not handled properly. The operation of the VOX intercom can be severely degraded by the quality and type or mix of microphones used in the aircraft. If one user has a very 'hot' microphone, it will present more electrical signal to the VOX circuit and the VOX SQUELCH will have to be set to quiet this microphone. The other microphones may not be able to generate enough electrical energy to overcome this VOX SQUELCH setting, and will break up or not be heard at all. 2.3.3 Notes Audio performance can be impaired by the introduction of airframe electrical noise at the headset jack locations. For best results, all headset jacks should be fully isolated from the airframe. 2.3.4 Cabling and Wiring All unshielded wire should be MIL-W-22759 or equivalent. For shielded wire applications, use Tefzel MIL-C-27500 shielded wire with solder sleeves (for shield terminations) to make the most compact and easily terminated interconnect. Follow the wiring diagrams in Section 2.6 as required. Allow 3 inches from the end of the wire to the shield termination to allow the hood to be easily installed. Note that the hood is a ‘clamshell’ hood, and is installed after the wiring is complete. All wiring should be at least 22 AWG, except power and ground lines, which should be at least 20 AWG. Ensure that all ground connections are clean and well secured. 2.3.5 Post-Installation Checks If any preset requires adjustment, be sure this is carried out before the aircraft leaves, and that the unit and its mating connector are secured before departure. Make all required log book entries, electrical load, weight and balance amendments and other paperwork as required by your local regulatory agency.

AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller Manual SM69 Rev. 4.00 3.3 Operation Specifics 3.3.1 Radio Selection VOX/TX Annunciator RX Select Switches TX Select Switch 3.3.1.1 Receive The AA12S is typically configured to select the RX audio from three transceivers and up to four additional receivers. The RX Select switches are white double-throw centre-off switches. Receiver audio can be selected by setting the appropriate RX select switch to the down position. Transceiver audio can either be selected by setting the appropriate RX select switch to the up position, or as a function of the TX select switch. The transceiver that is selected by the TX select switch is also automatically selected for receive. Receive/sidetone audio for the selected COM is automatically provided. When a switch is in the centre-off position, no transceiver/receiver audio is selected. 3.3.1.2 Transmit The TX select switch is a 4-position rotary control that provides radio selection for up to three transceivers and a PA. By selecting the desired transceiver and pressing the external TX PTT switch, the AA12S is activated for transmit operation, connecting the respective mic to the selected transceiver. The transceiver that is selected by the TX select switch is also automatically selected for receive. The front panel annunciator will illuminate green to indicate transmit operation (see section 3.1.3.) TX selections are available only to the pilot and copilot. Activation of either TX PTT input connects the user’s MIC to the selected COM, and activates the output PTT to the selected COM. When PTT is pressed, all audio except the sidetone of the selected COM and NAV inputs is removed from the headphone of the particular PTT user. The sidetone of the active COM is provided from the COM radio. The PA position provides PA mic audio and PA keyline to an external amplifier (e.g. AA21, AA23, PA250) for use as either a Loudhailer or Passenger Address system. A priority transmission feature allows the pilot to override the co-pilot.

SM69 Rev. 4.00 AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller Manual 3.3.1.3 VOX/TX Annunciator The VOX/TX Annunciator is a bicolour LED that indicates the intercom status. During VOX activity, the annunciator LED is illuminated red . If TX is keyed with no ICS or sidetone, the annunciator LED is illuminated green . If TX is keyed with mic or sidetone, the combination of red and green will cause the LED to appear amber . Note : If the LED is still illuminated green after transmission is concluded, this indicates a possible stuck mic. 3.3.2 Intercom ICS VOL/VOX Squelch Control The VOX and ICS VOL control is a fluted concentric knob, with the ICS volume on the centre knob, and the VOX control on the outer knob. 3.3.2.1 VOX Control The VOX control is used to set the level of audio required to activate the microphones. The AA12S provides three modes of intercom operation, selected by the position of the VOX control. LIVE ICS When the VOX control is positioned fully counter-clockwise (ccw), all mics will be live, and any sound picked up by the microphone(s) will be processed by the ICS system KEYED ICS When the VOX control is positioned fully clockwise (cw), the intercom will be in a keyed-only mode. VOX ICS When the VOX control is positioned between fully cw and fully ccw, the intercom is in VOX mode. To establish the VOX threshold, rotate the control ccw until the LED turns red, and then rotate the control cw until the LED goes dark. Continue turning the control cw until the desired voice sensitivity is set.

AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller Manual SM69 Rev. 4.00 3.3.2.2 ICS Volume Control The ICS VOL control, which has a line to mark rotational position, is at minimum volume when fully ccw. As the knob is rotated cw, the ICS volume for crew and PAX increases. The ICS is muted during transmit operations. 3.3.3 PILOT ISO / NORM Modes Pilot Isolate Switch The PILOT ISO/NORM control is a red, two-position toggle switch that allows selection of either NORM (Normal) or PILOT ISO (Pilot Isolate). In NORM mode (default) everyone on the system can talk to each other, listen to music, and hear all selected radio audio. The PILOT ISO mode separates the pilot from the intercom network, allowing confidential radio communications without interference from the copilot or passenger intercom or music, while maintaining complete control of all the radio functions of the audio panel. The copilot and passengers retain normal intercom and music functions. Note : In PILOT ISO mode, the receive/sidetone levels may require adjustment at the audio source. 3.3.4 Entertainment Audio The AA12S accepts stereo music input from portable entertainment units, CD players or other integrated on-board systems. The stereo output delivers music to stereo, or standard monaural, general aviation headsets (installation dependent). Music muting occurs during any radio or intercom activity.

SM69 Rev. 4.00 AA12S Series Compact Audio Controller Manual 3.3.5 Automatic Fail-safe In the event of a power failure, automatic fail-safe operation will be activated. This routes the pilot’s phones, mic audio, and mic PTT directly to the COM radio selected by the position of the TX rotary selector switch, and selected audio inputs. Copilot and passengers will have no ICS, music, or receive functions. In the unlikely event of an AA12S circuit failure that results in a communication failure, the automatic fail-safe mode can be enabled by pulling the AA12S circuit breaker. Note : In Automatic Fail-Safe mode, the receive/sidetone levels may require adjustment at the audio source. The pilot should confirm that all aspects of Automatic Fail-Safe operation are working before accepting the aircraft into service.
