Description The AKG Model C 747 gradient condenser microphone uses a short section interference tube to enhance its directional characteristics, making it an excellent choice for unobtrusive speech applications when mounted on a podium or lectern, or for teleconferencing activities. The microphone is about the size of a ballpoint pen and the mini-gooseneck extension facilitates adjustment and height. The finish is dark gray matte. Frequency response extends from 30 Hz to 18 kHz, and polar response is very uniform. The microphone can handle sound pressure levels of 133 dB with only 1% THD and operates with phantom powering over the standard ranges from 12 to 48 volts. Specifications Transducer Principle: Pre-polarized condenser Frequency Range: 30–18,000 Hz Polar Pattern: Hypercardioid 8.5 mV/ Pa = ^ -42 dBV Sensitivity at 1,000 Hz: Equivalent Noise Level: 21 dB-A Sound Pressure Level for 1% THD: 133 dB S/N Ratio (A-weighted): 73 dB Electr. Impedance: ≤ 400 ohms Load Impedance: > 1,500 ohms Power Requirement: 9-52 volts phantom powering Connector: 3-pin XLR type Cable Length: 10 ft. (3 m) Finish: Dark gray matte Size: Dia 0.35 in.
