Description The CK 33 is a hypercardioid modular screw-on capsule with smooth response from 50 Hz to 20 kHz. All 30-series capsules feature pre-polarized condenser elements with gold plated contacts to ensure reliable connections and trouble- free performance. The CK 33 capsule can be used with any of the “Discreet Acoustics Modular Series” installation modules. Each 30-series capsule has a dual layer windscreen; the dark gray outer layer disperses the impinging air stream while the inside layer smoothes the air stream before it reaches the diaphragm. This two-stage process efficiently reduces wind noise while maintaining acoustic transparency.
