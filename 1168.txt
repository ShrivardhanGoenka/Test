Smith INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS 1. Condensate Drain – This is a fully condensing water heater and should be located near a drain to permit proper disposal of condensate. 2. Vent Termination – Exhaust gases of this water heater are less than 140° F. In cold climates water vapor in ﬂue gases will condense into a cloud of vapor where the vent exits the building. This vapor can gradually discolor exterior building surfaces. Vent termination should be located where this vapor cloud and potential discoloration are not a concern. Locating vent termination 6˝ or more from the wall helps vapor from being trapped along a building’s face. To avoid this problem, the vent can be terminated on the roof. Always locate vent termination above the maximum snowline, and do not locate vent termination above a walkway. 3 Air Intake – In cold climates, air intake should be located at least three feet from the vent termination of the water heater and any other appliance vents that discharge moisture-laden air (such as clothes dryers). This will help prevent freeze-over of the intake screen required to prevent foreign objects from entering the intake pipe. Air intake should be located above the maximum snowline. 4. Blockage Sensors – The water heater is equipped with sensors to shut it down if blockage of vent or air intake occurs. A light on the heater’s diagnostic panel will alert service technicians to this problem. 5. Noise – Vent terminal should be located away from bedroom windows or other areas where blower noise will be objectionable. Avoid venting into corners or conﬁned areas, which will amplify sound. Anchoring intake or vent pipe to walls or ceilings can cause noise to be transmitted to living areas, and isolation mounts should be used where anchoring is required. 6 Optional Concentric Vent Kit - Helps to minimize unsightly wall/roof penetrations.
