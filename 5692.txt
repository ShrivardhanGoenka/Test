OPERATION HOW TO USE YOUR SPREADER SETTING THE FLOW CONTROL (Refer to figure 13 on page 7.) 1. Loosen the nylon wing nut, set the adjustable stop to the desired flow rate setting and retighten the wing nut. The higher the setting number, the wider the opening in the bottom of the hopper. 2. Refer to the application chart on page 10 and to the instructions on the fertilizer bag to select the proper flow rate setting. 3. Pull the flow control arm against the adjustable stop for the on position and toward the hopper for the off position. USING YOUR SPREADER We do not recommend the use of any powdered lawn chemicals, due to difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory or consistent broadcast pattern. 1. Determine approximate square footage of area to be covered and estimate amount of material required. 2. Before filling the hopper make sure the flow control arm is in the off position and the closure plate is shut. 3. Break up any lumpy fertilizer as you fill the hopper. 4. Set the adjustable stop with the flow control arm still in the off position. Refer to the application chart on page 10 and to the instructions on the fertilizer bag to select the proper flow rate setting. 5. The application chart is calculated for light to heavy application at a walking speed of 3 mph, or 100 ft. in 23 seconds. A variation in speed will require an adjustment of the flow rate to maintain the same coverage. The faster you walk, the wider the broad- cast width. 6. Always start the spreader in motion before opening the closure plate. 7. Always shut the closure plate before turning or stop- ping the spreader. 8. If fertilizer is accidentally deposited too heavily in a small area, soak the area thoroughly with a garden hose or sprinkler to prevent burning of the lawn. 9. To insure uniform coverage, make each pass so that the broadcast pattern slightly overlaps the pattern from the previous pass as shown in figure 17. The approximate broadcast widths for different materials are shown in the application chart on this page. 10. When broadcasting weed control fertilizers, make sure the broadcast pattern does not hit evergreen trees, flowers or shrubs. Lower the spreader shield to limit the dispersal pattern. Reduce the flow control setting according to the application chart on page 10. 11. Heavy moisture conditions may require a cover over the hopper to keep contents dry. The vinyl cover (available as an accessory) acts as a wind and mois- ture shield, but should not be used as a rain cover. Refer to the parts list on page 13.

IMPORTANT: Application rates shown in the chart are affected by humidity and by the moisture content of the material (granular and pellet). Some minor setting adjustments may be necessary to compensate for this condition. APPLICATION CHART (SHIELD UP) TYPE FLOW SETTING SPREAD MATERIAL 3 MPH WIDTH (100 FT. IN 23 SEC.)

MAINTENANCE CHECK FOR LOOSE FASTENERS 1. Before each use make a thorough visual check of the spreader for any bolts and nuts which may have loosened. Retighten any loose bolts and nuts. CHECK FOR WORN OF DAMAGED PARTS 2. Check for worn or damaged parts before each use. Repair or replace parts if necessary. CHECK TIRE INFLATION 3. Check if tires are adequately inflated before each use. Do not inflate tires beyond maximum recommended pressure. CAUTION: DO NOT inflate tires beyond the maximum recommended pressure printed on side of tire. CLEANING 4. Rinse inside of hopper and exterior of spreader and dry off before storing. LUBRICATE (See figure 18) 5. Lightly apply automotive grease as needed to the sprocket and gear. 6. Oil the nylon bushings on the vertical sprocket shaft and on the axle at least once a year, or more often as needed. 7. Oil right hand (idler) wheel at least once a year or more often as needed. OIL FIGURE 19 FIGURE 18 OIL GREASE STORAGE 1. Rinse inside of hopper and exterior of spreader and dry off before storing. 2. Store in a clean, dry area. SERVICE AND ADJUSTMENTS 1. If the axle, slotted gear and sprocket assembly is disassembled, mark down the positions of the parts as they are removed. The drive wheel and sprocket positions in relation to the slotted gear determine which direction the spreader plate will spin. Be sure to reassemble them in their original positions. (Refer to figure 3 on page 4.) Use shim washers (Ref. no. 20 on pages 12 and 13) as needed for minimum backlash. Add grease to gear and sprocket. 2. If the agitator hairpin becomes damaged or worn it can be replaced. Remove old agitator hairpin from hole in sprocket shaft and replace with new agitator hairpin. See figure 19. 11 SPROCKET SHAFT AGITATOR HAIRPIN
