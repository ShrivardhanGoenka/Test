Normally, category-5 twisted pair cable is adopted to connect the 10BASE-T /100BASE-TX Ethernet interface to the Ethernet, as shown in the following figure: Figure 2-2 Ethernet cable Ethernet cables fall into two categories: straight-through cables and crossover cables, specifically, Straight-through cable: the wire sequences of the twisted pair cable crimped in � the RJ-45 connectors at both ends are completely the same. It is used to connect terminal devices (such as PCs, routers) to Hubs or LAN Switches. Crossover cable: The wire sequences of twisted pair cable crimped in the RJ-45 � connectors at both ends are different. It can be used to connect two terminal devices (such as PCs and Routers). You can such kind of cables by yourself if necessary. If the SIC has been properly installed, follow these steps to connect the interface cable: Step 1: Connect the Ethernet port of SIC to a PC or router using a crossover cable and to a Hub or LAN Switch using a straight-through cable; Step 2: Power on the Router and check the SLOT1 LED on its front panel: ON means that the SIC is operating normally and OFF means that the Power-On Self-Test (POST) of the SIC has failed. In the latter case, please contact your agent. Step 3: Check the status of LINK LED on the panel: ON means the link is connected and OFF means the link is not connected. In the latter case, check the line. 2-2
3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Module Guide Chapter 2 Smart Interface Cards 2.2 Router 1-Port Serial SIC 2.2.1 Introduction 1-port multiprotocol synchronous/asynchronous serial interface card (Router 1-Port Serial SIC) supports both synchronous and asynchronous operating modes. It supports: Transmission/Receiving and handling of synchronous and asynchronous serial � data streams; Different operating modes, such as V.24/V.35 and DTE/DCE, depending on the � actual applications; Automatic external cable type detection without the need of manual configuration; � Local loopback and remote loopback, facilitating fault test and location. � I. Synchronous and asynchronous In different operating modes, a synchronous/asynchronous serial interface supports different signal standards and baud rates and the maximum transmission distance of the signals is related to the baud rate setting. For the relationships between cable type, baud rate setting and signal transmission distance, see the following table. Table 2-3 Baud rate and transmission distance of V.24 (RS232)/V.35 cable V.24 (RS232) V.35 Baud rate (bps) 2400 60 2400 1250 4800 60 4800 625 9600 30 9600 312 19200 30 19200 156 38400 20 38400 78 64000 20 56000 60 115200 10 64000 50 - - 2048000 30 Maximum transmission Baud rate (bps) Distance (m) 2-3 Maximum transmission Distance (m)
3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Module Guide Chapter 2 Smart Interface Cards 2.2.2 Appearance Caution: The baud rate cannot exceed 64 kbps if V.24 cable is used and the interface operates in synchronous mode. II. DTE and DCE The synchronous serial interface supports both DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) and DCE (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment) operating modes. Given that two devices are directly connected, if one operates in the DTE mode, the other will operate in the DCE mode. The DCE device provides the synchronous clock and specifies the communicating rate. The DTE device receives the synchronous clock and communicates at the specified rate. Generally, the Router is used as a DTE device. To make sure that the device is a DTE or DCE, refer to the manual shipped with this device. In addition, the following table may also help you to identify the type of the device. Table 2-4 Typical DTE and DCE equipment Equipment type Interface type Typical equipment DTE Male PC, Router DCE Female Modem, Multiplexer, CSU/DSU Asynchronous serial interface is generally used as dialing port and connected to a modem or a Terminal Adapter (TA). In this case, regardless of the operating mode of the device, only an appropriate baud rate for the interface needs to be selected. Synchronous serial interface is generally used for the direct connection to such a device as DDN, frame relay, or X.25 switch. Router 1-Port Serial SIC is illustrated in the following figure: 2-4

3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Module Guide Chapter 2 Smart Interface Cards 2.3.6 Connecting Interface Cable Caution: The relevant cables have been included in the standard configurations of Router 2-Port ISDN-S/T SIC and Router 2-Port ISDN-U SIC. Caution: � You should connect a cable to the port with the correct mark. Misplugging is prone to impair the SIC/MIM and even damage the router. � When using a telephone cable with ferrite core outdoors, you are recommended to install a special lightning arrester on the input end of the cable in order to avoid lightning more effectively. If the SIC has been properly installed, follow these steps to connect the cable: Step 1: Confirm the type of the ISDN line provided by your telecom service provider; Step 2: Connect the cable; For Router 2-Port ISDN-S/T SIC � If the ISDN U interface is adopted for the line, use NT1 for conversion. The connecting procedure is to insert one end of the telephone cable with ferrite core into the BRI S/T interface of Router 2-Port ISDN-S/T SIC and the other end into the NT1. If the line uses the ISDN S/T interface, directly insert the cable with ferrite core into the BRI S/T interface of the Router 2-Port ISDN-S/T SIC and the other end into the ISDN S/T interface. For Router 2-Port ISDN-U SIC � If the ISDN U interface is adopted for the line, directly insert the cable with ferrite core into the BRI U interface of the Router 2-Port ISDN-U SIC and the other end into the ISDN U interface. If the line uses the ISDN S/T interface, contact the agent and replace the SIC with Router 2-Port ISDN-S/T SIC. Step 3: Power on the Router, and check the corresponding Related LED on the front panel of the Router. If the LED is ON, it indicates that the SIC has passed the self-test and can operate normally.

3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Chapter 3 Module Guide Multifunctional Interface Modules (Router 5000) 3.4.5 Troubleshooting 1) Symptom 1: All the LEDs are OFF after the Router is started up. Troubleshooting: All the LEDs should fast blink once upon the startup of the device. They are keeping ON if the module or some hardware of the module is not powered on properly. Check whether the power supply is correctly connected. If the power supply is operating, the fuse might be blown or anomalies have occurred to the Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD). In this case, please contact your agent. 2) Symptom 2: All the LEDs are steadily ON after the device is started up. Troubleshooting: All the LEDs should fast blink once upon the startup of the device and then go OFF immediately, if the processor of the module starts working. All the LEDs are ON steadily, if the system bus of the module is not in normal state or anomalies have occurred to the CPLD. 3) Symptom 3: RUN LED is ON steadily. Troubleshooting: When the module is operating, RUN LED should fast blinks, instead of keeping ON steadily. RUN LED is steadily ON, if the module is powered up but not started normally, or if the module is reset forcibly. If at the same time other one or two LEDs (such as ACT, SPEED, and DENY) are ON, it is likely the problem of the NDEC or the Router. RUN LED keeps ON after several times of blinking, if module initialization fails. 4) Symptom 4: RUN LED is fast blinking all the time when the device is being started up. Troubleshooting: After the Router is powered ON, RUN LED fast blinks all the time until module initialization is completed. During the process, if DENY LED blinks occasionally, there might be fault in the memory. In this case, please contact your agent for repairing the module. SPEED LED lights during the process, if the module system boot fails. In this case, check the configuration of the system or contact your agent. 5) Symptom 5: RUN LED blinks slowly after the device is started up. Troubleshooting: If the module is in offline state, the RUN LED blinks slowly. Check that the configuration of the Router is correct, and make sure NEDC is supported. 6) Symptom 6: ACT LED is ON steadily. Troubleshooting: If the firmware is being upgraded, ACT LED blinks. If the upgrade fails, the LED is ON steadily and you need to upgrade the software again. If the problem still exists, contact your agent. 7) Symptom 7: DENY LED blinks during normal operations. Troubleshooting: DENY LED blinks during normal operations, if the module performance or capacity is inadequate for encryption processing at a moment. This is not a hardware failure but a phenomenon caused by technical specifications limitation 3-17

Pins 1 and 2 of the interface are used for transmitting data, and pins 3 and 6 are used for receiving data. Figure 3-23 Ethernet cable II. Making Ethernet cables You can use category 5 twisted-pair cables to make Ethernet cables. A category 5 twisted-pair cable is composed of eight wires that are identified and grouped by colors of the outer insulator. Usually a solid color wire and a white/solid color wire are organized in pairs. But sometimes, wires are also paired by color dots. Ethernet cables fit into two categories: straight-through and crossover. Straight-through cable: The wires are crimped in the RJ-45 connectors at both � ends in the same order. The cable is used for connecting a terminal device (for 3-19

The cables delivered with the router are straight-through cables. Crossover cable: The wires are crimped in the RJ-45 connectors at both ends in � different orders. The cable is used for connecting two terminal devices (for example, PC and router). You can make cables as needed. � Note: In making network cables, shielded cables are preferred for electromagnetic compatibility sake. The interface cables in the standard package of cards are straight-through cables. Step 1: Plug one end of the cable to an Ethernet port on the router and another end to the device to be connected. (For a PC or router, use a straight-through cable; for a HUB or LAN switch, use a crossover cable.) Step 2: Power on the router and check the behavior of the LINK LED on the panel: ON means that a link is present and OFF means that no link is present. In the latter case, check the line status. Caution: Before you connect a port, read its label carefully; a wrong connection can cause damages to the interface card and even the device. 4-port high-speed sync/async serial interface module (Router 4-Port Serial MIM) supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes to transmit/receive and handle data streams at sync/async serial interfaces. The modules also support Data Terminal Equipment/Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DTE/DCE) mode when they are in synchronous operating mode. I. Synchronous and asynchronous In different operating modes, a sync/async serial interface supports different signal standards and baud rates. And the maximum transmission distance of signals is related to the baud rate setting. For the relationships between cable type, baud rate setting and signal transmission distance, see the following table. 3-20

II. Introduction to DTE and DCE Synchronous serial interfaces support both DTE and DCE operating modes. Given two directly connected devices, if one operates in the DTE mode, the other will operate in the DCE mode. The DCE device provides the synchronous clock and specifies the communicating rate. The DTE device receives the synchronous clock and communicates at the specified rate. Generally, the Router is used as a DTE device. To make sure that the device is a DTE or DCE, refer to the manual shipped with this device. In addition, the following table may also help you to identify the type of the device.

3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Chapter 3 Module Guide Multifunctional Interface Modules (Router 5000) 3.7 Router 2 AND 4-Port Enhanced Serial MIM 3.7.1 Introduction Caution: Before connecting an SA module, confirm the model of the equipment to be connected to the SA module (that is, sync/async mode, DTE/DCE mode, and so on), signaling criterion required by the access equipment, baud rate, and timing clock. I. Connecting interface cable of Router 4-Port Serial MIM Step 1: Plug the DB-100 connector of a Router 4-Port Serial MIM conversion cable to the appropriate DB-100 port on the Router 4-Port Serial MIM module; Step 2: Select a correct sync/async serial interface cable. Connect one end of the cable to the DB50 connector of the Router 4-Port Serial MIM conversion cable and the other end to: Port of CSU/DSU, if the WAN is a DDN line; � Serial port of analog modem, if the WAN is a dial-up line; � Step 3: Power on the Router, and check the LEDs of the corresponding slot on the front panel: ON means that the MIM is operating normally and OFF means that the POST of the MIM has failed. In the latter case, please contact your agent. Step 4: Check the behavior of the LINK LED on the Router 4-Port Serial MIM panel. It is OFF when the line is faulty and signal is out of synchronization. Caution: You should connect a cable to the port with the correct mark. Misplugging is prone to impair the SIC/MIM and even damage the router. Router 2 AND 4-Port Enhanced Serial MIM, 2-/4-port enhanced high-speed sync/async serial interface card, transmits, receives, and processes data on the synchronous/asynchronous serial interface. They support both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In the former case, they support the DTE/DCE mode. I. DTE and DCE An FIC-SA card is usually connected to an external modem for dialing purpose, where an appropriate baud rate setting is required. 3-25
3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Chapter 3 Module Guide Multifunctional Interface Modules (Router 5000) 3.7.2 Interface Attributes The synchronous serial interface can work in either DTE or DCE mode. Two directly connected devices must work as DTE and DCE respectively. The DCE provides clock synchronization and specifies the communication rate, whereas the DTE accepts clock synchronization and communicates at the specified rate. The router normally works as a DTE. To identify whether the equipment connected to the router is DTE or DCE, refer to the manual shipped with the equipment. II. Speed and transmission segment of synchronous/asynchronous serial interface In different operating modes, the synchronous/asynchronous serial interface supports different electric signal specifications and baud rates. In addition, the maximum signal transmission segment depends not only on the specified baud rate but also on the selected cable. The following table shows how the cable type, baud rate, and the maximum signal transmission segment related to each other.

The cables delivered with the router are straight-through cables. Crossover cable: The wires are crimped in the RJ-45 connectors at both ends in � different orders. The cable is used for connecting two terminal devices (for example, PC and router). You can make cables as needed. � Note: In making network cables, shielded cables are preferred for electromagnetic compatibility sake. The interface cables in the standard package of Router 2-Port 10/100 cards are straight-through cables. Step 1: Plug one end of the cable to an Ethernet port on the router and another end to the device to be connected. (For a PC or router, use a straight-through cable; for a HUB or LAN switch, use a crossover cable.) Step 2: Power on the router and check the on the FIC-FE panel: ON means that a link is present and OFF means that no link is present. In the latter case, check the line status. Caution: Before you connect a port, read its label carefully; a wrong connection can cause damages to the interface card and even the device.

3Com Router 5000 and Router 6000 v2.41 Module Guide Chapter 4 Flexible Interface Cards (Router 6000) 4.2.2 Interface Attributes � Note: Depending on how light travels, optical fibers are divided into multi-mode optical fiber and single-mode optical fiber. Single-mode optical fiber has very thin core, and transmits only in single mode on a given wavelength. It features wide band and large transmission capacity. Multi-mode optical fiber allows transmission in multiple modes on a given wavelength. In multi-mode, lights in different modes travel at different speeds, resulting in phase distortion and thus limiting the transmission band.
