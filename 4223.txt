However, existing copper access networks do not facilitate an end-to-end high-bandwidth connection, creating a bottleneck. This bottleneck is the first mile of access. This refers to the access link (most often a TDM-based copper circuit) from the business customer’s office LAN to their service provider’s MAN. ADTRAN affords service providers the ability to remove this bottleneck through the utilization of an improved data transmission standard. This standard, ITU-T G.998.2, is known as Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM). ADTRAN EFM over Copper (EoCu) defines a way to effectively and universally bond together, lower band- width copper loops or pairs of wires creating a Carrier Ethernet access connection. This innovative EoCu solution enables service providers to extend packet-based business-class services beyond the reach of their fiber network by leveraging the existing investment of copper-based TDM business services assets. This means leveraging the full advantages of TDM, the most understood, successful, and ubiquitous business service infrastructure. Due to budget restrictions and time to market requirements, deploying fiber to address uneven or disperse service demand is not feasible, leaving a large percentage of businesses to rely on copper business access. The ADTRAN EoCu solution is comprised of the NetVanta 800 family of NTU and can be launched from our Total Access 3000 and Total Access 5000 platforms. The NetVanta 830 Series NTU delivers enhanced data rate capabilities to deliver up to 45 Mbps of Ethernet service over bonded e.SHDSL. The NetVanta 810 Series NTU leverages the existing copper-based TDM business services assets to rapidly extend Ethernet service to any customer who currently uses DS1 or E1 service. The NetVanta 873 can EFM bond up to three DS3 connections to deliver up to 134 Mbps of Carrier Ethernet service. Smart Solutions for a Connected World. International Quality of Service Flexibility and Assurance The NetVanta 800 Series deliver packet flow capabilities certified compliant per the Metro Ethernet Forum. These packet flow capa- bilities offer the traffic classification and bandwidth profiling capabilities required to offer customers a flexible, tiered service offer. In addition to this highly configurable, granular bandwidth selection toolset enabling Quality of Service (QoS) options, these same network termination points support the standards-based measurement and moni- toring capabilities required to maintain a carrier-grade Ethernet network. All of this allows providers to create and meet customer SLA agreements. Reliable Service Connection Mechanisms In the event a single loop fails, the NetVanta 800 offers resiliency, maintaining traffic over the remaining active loops in order to maintain service. Once the failed loop is operational again, the NetVanta will auto- matically detect its availability and return the loop to the bonded group, providing the orig- inal provisioned customer bandwidth. When deployed through the Total Access 5000, these NTUs tap into an unparalleled array of copper loop diagnostic tools that afford an even greater service assurance level. Simplified Service Delivery In order to improve service time to market and reduce deployment costs, the NetVanta 800 Series delivers a feature set designed to simplify service deployment and mainte- nance. ADTRAN Total Access EMS employs EZ-Ethernet Provisioning, minimizing the number of steps to provision a new service. The EIA-232 craft port enables local access for configuration and status information. A management VLAN is used to remotely configure and collect status information. The compact chassis and flexible deployment options offer wallmount or rackmount for superior flexibility. When wallmounted, any NetVanta 800 only occupies a 17-inch by 10-inch area of the customer’s telephone wiring closet. For rackmount installations, custom 19-inch rackmount shelves are available.
