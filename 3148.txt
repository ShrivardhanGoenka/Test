Another clever feature, which could save you the precious seconds that could mean a life. Size it up! TM alluring measurements are The GlobalWatch (H) 7.9" (20 cm) x (W) 11" (28 cm) and it's only 2.4" (6 cm) deep. It's lightweight at 5.5 Ibs. (2.49 kg), and will not take up precious space on your bridge, even though keyboard and display are integrated. Plug & Play Inventive technology at its best! Two sockets suffice to connect power, sensors and anten- nas. Initial Transponder operation is up and running within minutes. Complimentary training software Training Software simulates all Transponder functions. It is especially valuable for simulating emergencies at sea and practising the handling of alarms, long range interface requests and messaging. The free software is available upon request.
