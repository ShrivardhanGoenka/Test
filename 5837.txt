WIRING DIAGRAM: JB-DVF-HID-I TESTING AND OPERATION: When power is applied to the iClass reader, the LED will turn RED while the beeper beeps simultaneously 3 times. (The last tone is a higher frequency). The LED will then flash once after the last tone. This indicates that the microcontroller is operating properly. Present an iClass ID card to the reader (Hold the card directly in front of reader). The LED will momentarily turn green while the beeper beeps once, indicating that the card was read successfully.
