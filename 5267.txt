Operation Agilent 83491/2/3A Modules—At a Glance Agilent 83491/2/3A Modules—At a Glance The Agilent 83491/2/3A are designed to operate in an Agilent 83480A digital communications analyzer. These modules recover clock and data information at standard telecom and datacom rates. The resulting trigger signal is made available to the Agilent 83480A mainframe via a connector located on the module’s rear-panel. An external front-panel cable passes the data signal, with some insertion loss, to the receiver module. Table 2-1.

WAR N I N G Light energy can radiate from the front panel OUTPUT connectors on Agilent 83492A and 83493A modules. The light emitted from these connectors is the slightly attenuated light that is input to the front- panel INPUT connector. Use with Agilent 71603B or 71612B Error Performance Analyzers The front-panel Data and Clock outputs provide electrical recovered clock and regenerated data signals for simultaneous testing with other instruments, such as the Agilent 71603B or 71612B error performance analyzers. Multimode module and single-mode reference receivers Agilent Technologies does not recommend using the Agilent 83492A multi- mode module with single-mode reference receivers such as the Agilent 83481A, 83482A, or 83485A,B modules. Connecting multimode to sin- gle-mode fibers causes large reflections and insertion loss because of the reduction of the optical fiber’s core from 62.5 µ m to 9 µ m. Single-mode module and multimode reference receivers It is acceptable to use an Agilent 83493A single-mode module with a multi- mode reference receiver such as the Agilent 83486A module. This is true pro- vided that single-mode fiber is connected to the Agilent 83493A module’s front-panel INPUT connector. What you won’t find on these modules.... Unlike other modules designed to be used with the Agilent 83480A digital communica- tions analyzer, the Agilent 83491/2/3A modules do not include Channel keys or menus. Also, there are no GPIB programming commands for these modules. Operation Agilent 83491/2/3A Modules—At a Glance 2-3
SELECT key Pressing this key changes the modulation rate of the input signal. The recov- ered and retimed clock trigger is sent to the mainframe. The Trigger On Data selection is a bypass mode where the data stream directly triggers the main- frame. Refer to “Block Diagrams” on page 2-7 to view a schematic of the nor- mal and bypass paths. Operation Front-Panel Features Front-Panel Features Figure 2-2. Agilent 83491/2/3A front panels 2-4
UNLOCKED This light shows when clock recovery cannot be established on the signal. If a indicator clock rate is selected, the trigger output to the mainframe is disabled to pre- vent free-run triggering. However in bypass mode ( Trigger On Data selected), triggering is not disabled. When the UNLOCKED light is on, you can establish a trigger on the data input to the reference receiver. Auxiliary outputs DATA connector: This connector provides a fully regenerated version of the input signal. It is intended for monitoring purposes only and not for rigorous eye mask compliance testing. The frequency response does not conform to the requirements for eye mask testing as described in ITU-T G.957 and Bellcore GR-253-CORE. On Agilent 83492A and 83493A modules, this port is ampli- tude stabilized for input signals greater than approximately –23 dBm. Input and Output The input connectors pass the digitally modulated signal to the receiver mod- connectors ule. The input signal, slightly attenuated and available at the OUTPUT connec- tor, is connected to the input of any of the Agilent 83481,2,3,4,5,6, or 7 modules. The connectors on optical modules include adapters which can eas- ily be changed to match the type of connectors that are used on your fiber- optic cables. Refer to “Front-Panel Optical Adapters” on page 4-2 for a description of the available adapters. Green and red data-rate lights The data-rate indicator lights change color between red and green to show which data rate is selected. A red light does not indicate a problem. A red light shows that the adja- cent red data rate label is selected. A green light shows that the adjacent green data rate label is selected. Repeatedly pressing the SELECT key cycles through the selections in one color before switching to the opposite color. On Agilent 83491A modules for example, the first selection cycle shows 155 Mb/s selected. The second section cycle shows 1062 Mb/s selected. CLOCK c onnector: This connector provides the recovered clock signal. You can use this signal to measure jitter transfer, because this output can track and fol- low input data with very fast jitter; it has a wide bandwidth jitter transfer func- tion when compared to the recovered clock signal which is routed through a rear-panel connector to the mainframe for triggering. Note that the CLOCK Aux- iliary Output remains synchronized to input signals several dB below the onset of errors at the DATA Auxiliary Output . Operation Front-Panel Features 2-5
Recovered Clock The recovered clock signal is routed directly to the Agilent 83480A mainframe through the module’s rear panel. This output has a lower jitter modulation bandwidth than the front-panel CLOCK Auxiliary Output . Because of the reduced jitter modulation bandwidth on the mainframe trigger signal, a more complete view of the jitter on the waveform data is obtained. Operation Front-Panel Features Multimode and single-mode connections Agilent 83492A modules use multimode fiber. Connecting the output to the Optical INPUT connector on Agilent 83481/2/5 single-mode modules results in large reflections and insertion loss. Agilent 83493A modules use 9/125 µ m single-mode fiber. Connecting multimode fiber to the Optical Input connector results in large reflections and insertion loss. 2-6

Operation To Display a Signal To Display a Signal 1 Install the module as described in “To install the module” on page 1-3. Be sure to connect all of the cables as described in the procedure. 2 Repeatedly press the SELECT key on the clock recovery module until the front- panel light indicates the proper data rate of the signal. Green and red data-rate lights The data-rate indicator lights change color between red and green to show which data rate is selected. A red light does not indicate a problem. A red light shows that the adja- cent red data rate label is selected. A green light shows that the adjacent green data rate label is selected. Repeatedly pressing the SELECT key cycles through the selections in one color before switching to the opposite color. On Agilent 83491A modules for example, the first selection cycle shows 155 Mb/s selected. The second section cycle shows 1062 Mb/s selected. If the UNLOCKED light is on, clock recovery cannot be established on the signal. Avoid selecting a data rate that is a multiple of the input signal. For example, don’t select a 622 Mb/s data rate if the signal is really at 155 Mb/s. If you cannot get the clock recovery module to lock on the signal, make sure that you have selected the correct data rate and that the Agilent 83480A (or Agilent 54750A) mainframe trigger level is adjusted appropriately. Signals displayed using a data trigger are less reliable than using a recovered clock. Signals triggered on data can also vary depending upon the trigger level. 2-8
To Compensate for Module Insertion Loss The following steps allow you to enter an offset to compensate for the inser- tion loss of the clock recovery module. This provides accurate amplitude mea- surements at the input to the clock recovery module. 1 Disconnect the cable from the clock recovery module’s Input connector. 2 Measure the signal using a power meter. You can use either the Agilent 83480A’s built-in power meter or an external power meter. 3 Reconnect the cable to the clock recovery module. 4 Disconnect the cable from the reference receiver module’s input connector. 5 Measure the signal using a power meter. You can use either the Agilent 83480A’s built-in power meter or an external power meter. 6 Subtract the two measurements to determine the insertion loss of the module.

Operation Using Probes with an Agilent 83491A Using Probes with an Agilent 83491A You can use external passive and active probes with the Agilent 83491A elec- trical clock recovery module. The procedures in this section generate vertical scale factors. These factors are applied to the calibration of the reference receiver module’s electrical channel. When selecting a probe, keep in mind that the input impedance of the Agilent 83491A is 50 Ω . If the probe being calibrated has an attenuation factor that allows the instru- ment to adjust the gain to produce even steps in the vertical scale factors, the instrument will do so. Typically, probes have standard attenuation factors such as divide by 10, divide by 20, or divide by 100. Because the following procedures include compensation for insertion loss of the clock recovery module, do not perform the procedure “To Compensate for Module Insertion Loss” on page 2-9. The following probes are available for use with Agilent 83491A clock recovery modules: Agilent N1020A TDR probe. This passive probe (1:1, 50 Ω ) provides a fixture for positioning and holding the probe tip on the device being tested. Agilent 54701A 2.5 GHz active probe. This is a 100k Ω, 10:1, probe.

This passive 500 Ω probe has an input capacitance of 1.5 pf. 2-10
To compensate for a passive probe 1 Connect the probe to the Input connector on the Agilent 83491A clock recovery module. 2 Attach the probe tip to the CAL hook that is located near the floppy disk drive. 3 Press the reference receiver module’s front-panel channel SETUP key. 4 Press Calibrate and then Calibrate probe . To compensate an Agilent 54701A active probe 1 Connect the Agilent 83491A output to the electrical measurement channel input. 2 Connect the probe to the Input connector on the Agilent 83491A clock recovery module. 3 Connect the probe power cable to the Probe Power connector on the reference receiver module. 4 Attach the probe tip to the CAL hook that is located near the floppy disk drive. 5 Press the reference receiver module’s front-panel channel SETUP key. 6 Press Calibrate and then Calibrate probe .

Operation Using Probes with an Agilent 83491A To compensate for other devices The information in this section applies to both optical and electrical measure- ments. Since the mainframe’s CAL signal is a voltage source, it cannot be used to calibrate to the probe tip when the units are set to Ampere, Watt, or Unknown. Instead, set the external gain and external offset to compensate for the actual characteristics of the device. If you do not know the actual charac- teristics, you can refer to the typical specifications that came with the device. 1 Press the reference receiver module’s front-panel channel SETUP key. 2 Press External scale . 3 Press Atten units Ratio , Attenuation 1:1 , and then Units Ampere (Volt, Watt, or Unknown). 4 Press Ext gain , and enter the actual gain characteristics of the device. 5 Press Ext offset , and enter the offset introduced by the device. 2-12

Reference Electrostatic Discharge Information Electrostatic Discharge Information Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage or destroy electronic components. All work on electronic assemblies should be performed at a static-safe work station. The following figure shows an example of a static-safe work station using two types of ESD protection: Conductive table-mat and wrist-strap combination. Conductive floor-mat and heel-strap combination. Figure 4-1. Static-safe work station 4-8
WAR N I N G These techniques for a static-safe work station should not be used when working on circuitry with a voltage potential greater than 500 volts. Both types, when used together, provide a significant level of ESD protection. Of the two, only the table-mat and wrist-strap combination provides adequate ESD protection when used alone. To ensure user safety, the static-safe accessories must provide at least 1 M Ω of isolation from ground. Refer to Table 4-1 for information on ordering static- safe accessories. Reducing ESD Damage The following suggestions may help reduce ESD damage that occurs during testing and servicing operations. Personnel should be grounded with a resistor-isolated wrist strap before re- moving any assembly from the unit. Be sure all instruments are properly earth-grounded to prevent a buildup of static charge. Table 4-1.

Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements Today, advances in measurement capabilities make connectors and connec- tion techniques more important than ever. Damage to the connectors on cali- bration and verification devices, test ports, cables, and other devices can degrade measurement accuracy and damage instruments. Replacing a dam- aged connector can cost thousands of dollars, not to mention lost time! This expense can be avoided by observing the simple precautions presented in this book. This book also contains a brief list of tips for caring for electrical connec- tors. Choosing the Right Connector A critical but often overlooked factor in making a good lightwave measure- ment is the selection of the fiber-optic connector. The differences in connec- tor types are mainly in the mechanical assembly that holds the ferrule in position against another identical ferrule. Connectors also vary in the polish, curve, and concentricity of the core within the cladding. Mating one style of cable to another requires an adapter. Agilent Technologies offers adapters for most instruments to allow testing with many different cables. Figure 4-2 on page 4-11 shows the basic components of a typical connectors. The system tolerance for reflection and insertion loss must be known when selecting a connector from the wide variety of currently available connectors. Some items to consider when selecting a connector are: How much insertion loss can be allowed? Will the connector need to make multiple connections? Some connectors are better than others, and some are very poor for making repeated connections. What is the reflection tolerance? Can the system take reflection degradation? Is an instrument-grade connector with a precision core alignment required? Is repeatability tolerance for reflection and loss important? Do your specifica- 4-10
tions take repeatability uncertainty into account? Will a connector degrade the return loss too much, or will a fusion splice be re- quired? For example, many DFB lasers cannot operate with reflections from connectors. Often as much as 90 dB isolation is needed. Figure 4-2. Basic components of a connector. Over the last few years, the FC/PC style connector has emerged as the most popular connector for fiber-optic applications. While not the highest perform- ing connector, it represents a good compromise between performance, reli- ability, and cost. If properly maintained and cleaned, this connector can withstand many repeated connections. However, many instrument specifications require tighter tolerances than most connectors, including the FC/PC style, can deliver. These instruments cannot tolerate connectors with the large non-concentricities of the fiber common with ceramic style ferrules. When tighter alignment is required, Agilent Technologies instruments typically use a connector such as the Diamond HMS-10, which has concentric tolerances within a few tenths of a micron. Agi- lent Technologies then uses a special universal adapter, which allows other cable types to mate with this precision connector. See Figure 4-3. Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements 4-11
Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements Figure 4-3. Universal adapters to Diamond HMS-10. The HMS-10 encases the fiber within a soft nickel silver (Cu/Ni/Zn) center which is surrounded by a tough tungsten carbide casing, as shown in Figure 4-4. Figure 4-4. Cross-section of the Diamond HMS-10 connector. The nickel silver allows an active centering process that permits the glass fiber to be moved to the desired position. This process first stakes the soft nickel silver to fix the fiber in a near-center location, then uses a post-active staking to shift the fiber into the desired position within 0.2 µ m. This process, plus the keyed axis, allows very precise core-to-core alignments. This connector is found on most Agilent Technologies lightwave instruments. 4-12
The soft core, while allowing precise centering, is also the chief liability of the connector. The soft material is easily damaged. Care must be taken to mini- mize excessive scratching and wear. While minor wear is not a problem if the glass face is not affected, scratches or grit can cause the glass fiber to move out of alignment. Also, if unkeyed connectors are used, the nickel silver can be pushed onto the glass surface. Scratches, fiber movement, or glass contamina- tion will cause loss of signal and increased reflections, resulting in poor return loss. Inspecting Connectors Because fiber-optic connectors are susceptible to damage that is not immedi- ately obvious to the naked eye, poor measurements result without the user being aware. Microscopic examination and return loss measurements are the best way to ensure good measurements. Good cleaning practices can help ensure that optimum connector performance is maintained. With glass-to- glass interfaces, any degradation of a ferrule or the end of the fiber, any stray particles, or finger oil can have a significant effect on connector performance. Where many repeat connections are required, use of a connector saver or patch cable is recommended. Figure 4-5 shows the end of a clean fiber-optic cable. The dark circle in the center of the micrograph is the fiber’s 125 µ m core and cladding which carries the light. The surrounding area is the soft nickel-silver ferrule. Figure 4-6 shows a dirty fiber end from neglect or perhaps improper cleaning. Material is smeared and ground into the end of the fiber causing light scattering and poor reflection. Not only is the precision polish lost, but this action can grind off the glass face and destroy the connector. Figure 4-7 shows physical damage to the glass fiber end caused by either repeated connections made without removing loose particles or using improper cleaning tools. When severe, the damage of one connector end can be transferred to another good connector endface that comes in contact with the damaged one. Periodic checks of fiber ends, and replacing connecting cables after many connections is a wise practice. The cure for these problems is disciplined connector care as described in the following list and in “Cleaning Connectors” on page 4-17. Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements 4-13
Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements Use the following guidelines to achieve the best possible performance when making measurements on a fiber-optic system: Never use metal or sharp objects to clean a connector and never scrape the connector. Avoid matching gel and oils. Figure 4-5. Clean, problem-free fiber end and ferrule. Figure 4-6. Dirty fiber end and ferrule from poor cleaning. 4-14
Figure 4-7. Damage from improper cleaning. While these often work well on first insertion, they are great dirt magnets. The oil or gel grabs and holds grit that is then ground into the end of the fiber. Also, some early gels were designed for use with the FC, non-contacting con- nectors, using small glass spheres. When used with contacting connectors, these glass balls can scratch and pit the fiber. If an index matching gel or oil must be used, apply it to a freshly cleaned connector, make the measurement, and then immediately clean it off. Never use a gel for longer-term connections and never use it to improve a damaged connector. The gel can mask the extent of damage and continued use of a damaged fiber can transfer damage to the instrument. When inserting a fiber-optic cable into a connector, gently insert it in as straight a line as possible. Tipping and inserting at an angle can scrape material off the inside of the connector or even break the inside sleeve of connectors made with ceramic material. When inserting a fiber-optic connector into a connector, make sure that the fi- ber end does not touch the outside of the mating connector or adapter. Avoid over tightening connections. Unlike common electrical connections, tighter is not better. The purpose of the connector is to bring two fiber ends together. Once they touch, tightening only causes a greater force to be applied to the delicate fibers. With connec- tors that have a convex fiber end, the end can be pushed off-axis resulting in misalignment and excessive return loss. Many measurements are actually improved by backing off the connector pressure. Also, if a piece of grit does happen to get by the cleaning procedure, the tighter connection is more likely to damage the glass. Tighten the connectors just until the two fibers touch. Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements 4-15
Reference Cleaning Connections for Accurate Measurements Keep connectors covered when not in use. Use fusion splices on the more permanent critical nodes. Choose the best con- nector possible. Replace connecting cables regularly. Frequently measure the return loss of the connector to check for degradation, and clean every connec- tor, every time. All connectors should be treated like the high-quality lens of a good camera. The weak link in instrument and system reliability is often the inappropriate use and care of the connector. Because current connectors are so easy to use, there tends to be reduced vigilance in connector care and cleaning. It takes only one missed cleaning for a piece of grit to permanently damage the glass and ruin the connector. Measuring insertion loss and return loss Consistent measurements with your lightwave equipment are a good indica- tion that you have good connections. Since return loss and insertion loss are key factors in determining optical connector performance they can be used to determine connector degradation. A smooth, polished fiber end should pro- duce a good return-loss measurement. The quality of the polish establishes the difference between the “PC” (physical contact) and the “Super PC” con- nectors. Most connectors today are physical contact which make glass-to-glass connections, therefore it is critical that the area around the glass core be clean and free of scratches. Although the major area of a connector, excluding the glass, may show scratches and wear, if the glass has maintained its polished smoothness, the connector can still provide a good low level return loss con- nection. If you test your cables and accessories for insertion loss and return loss upon receipt, and retain the measured data for comparison, you will be able to tell in the future if any degradation has occurred. Typical values are less than 0.5 dB of loss, and sometimes as little as 0.1 dB of loss with high performance con- nectors. Return loss is a measure of reflection: the less reflection the better (the larger the return loss, the smaller the reflection). The best physically contacting connectors have return losses better than 50 dB, although 30 to 40 dB is more common. 4-16
WAR N I N G Always remove both ends of fiber-optic cables from any instrument, system, or device before visually inspecting the fiber ends. Disable all optical sources before disconnecting fiber-optic cables. Failure to do so may result in permanent injury to your eyes. C AUT IO N Agilent Technologies strongly recommends that index matching compounds not be applied to their instruments and accessories. Some compounds, such as gels, may be difficult to remove and can contain damaging particulates. If you think the use of such compounds is necessary, refer to the compound manufacturer for information on application and cleaning procedures. Visual inspection of fiber ends Visual inspection of fiber ends can be helpful. Contamination or imperfections on the cable end face can be detected as well as cracks or chips in the fiber itself. Use a microscope (100X to 200X magnification) to inspect the entire end face for contamination, raised metal, or dents in the metal as well as any other imperfections. Inspect the fiber for cracks and chips. Visible imperfec- tions not touching the fiber core may not affect performance (unless the imperfections keep the fibers from contacting). Cleaning Connectors The procedures in this section provide the proper steps for cleaning fiber- optic cables and Agilent Technologies universal adapters. The initial cleaning, using the alcohol as a solvent, gently removes any grit and oil. If a caked-on layer of material is still present, (this can happen if the beryllium-copper sides of the ferrule retainer get scraped and deposited on the end of the fiber during insertion of the cable), a second cleaning should be performed. It is not uncommon for a cable or connector to require more than one cleaning. Table 4-2.

Cotton swabs can be used as long as no cotton fibers remain on the fiber end after cleaning. 2 Clean the ferrules and other parts of the connector while avoiding the end of the fiber. 3 Apply isopropyl alcohol to a new clean lint-free cotton swab or lens paper. 4 Clean the fiber end with the swab or lens paper. Do not scrub during this initial cleaning because grit can be caught in the swab and become a gouging element. 5 Immediately dry the fiber end with a clean, dry, lint-free cotton swab or lens paper. 6 Blow across the connector end face from a distance of 6 to 8 inches using filtered, dry, compressed air. Aim the compressed air at a shallow angle to the fiber end face. Nitrogen gas or compressed dust remover can also be used. 4-18
C AUT IO N Do not shake, tip, or invert compressed air canisters, because this releases particles in the can into the air. Refer to instructions provided on the compressed air canister. 7 As soon as the connector is dry, connect or cover it for later use. If the performance, after the initial cleaning, seems poor try cleaning the con- nector again. Often a second cleaning will restore proper performance. The second cleaning should be more arduous with a scrubbing action. To clean an adapter The fiber-optic input and output connectors on many Agilent Technologies instruments employ a universal adapter such as those shown in the following picture. These adapters allow you to connect the instrument to different types of fiber-optic cables. Figure 4-8. Universal adapters. 1 Apply isopropyl alcohol to a clean foam swab. Cotton swabs can be used as long as no cotton fibers remain after cleaning. The foam swabs listed in this section’s introduction are small enough to fit into adapters. Although foam swabs can leave filmy deposits, these deposits are very thin, and the risk of other contamination buildup on the inside of adapters greatly out- weighs the risk of contamination by foam swabs. 2 Clean the adapter with the foam swab. 3 Dry the inside of the adapter with a clean, dry, foam swab. 4 Blow through the adapter using filtered, dry, compressed air. Nitrogen gas or compressed dust remover can also be used. Do not shake, tip, or invert compressed air canisters, because this releases particles in the can into the air.
