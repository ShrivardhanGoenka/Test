KEEP THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN A CONVENIENT LOCATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. TO GUARD AGAINST INJURY, THE FOLLOWING BASIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS MUST BE OBSERVED IN THE SET-UP AND USE OF THIS PRODUCT. General safeguards Use the unit only for its intended purposes of laminating documents. Do not place anything in the throat opening of the laminator other than pouches/documents. Place unit on a secure, stable work area to prevent the unit from falling and possibly causing personal injury and damage to the unit. Follow all warnings and instructions marked on the unit. The socket outlet shall be installed near the equipment and shall be easily accessible. Do not block the vent slots, this will cause the laminator to overheat. Never insert the loose end of the pouch first into the machine. This could cause the machine to jam. Never attempt to do single sided lamination. This will cause the machine to jam. After laminating run a clean card through the machine to clean glue residue off of the rollers. This will extend the life of the rollers. Electrical safeguards The unit must be connected to a supply voltage corresponding to the electrical rating shown on the unit. Unplug the unit before moving it, or when it is not in use for an extended period of time. Do not operate with a damaged supply cord or plug. Do not alter the attachment plug. The plug is configured for the appropriate electrical supply. Do not overload electrical outlets beyond their capacity; fire or electrical shock could result. The unit is intended for indoor use only. Do not spill liquid of any kind on this product.  Close supervision is required when this product is used near children.
Operation, hot lamination 1 Connect the power cord plug to the appropriate power source. 2 Push the power button to “ON” position, the LCD display will illuminate. 3 Using the lamination guide located on the machine (fig.1), select the appropriate temperature setting for the pouch gauge thickness and material you are laminating using the Up/Down Arrow keys. Temperature Setting Guidelines When laminating thin paper with light ink coverage, set the temperature dial to the low end of the film gauge range. Thick paper with heavy ink coverage requires higher settings within the range. Temperature settings will vary due to the finish, chemistry and heat absorption properties of the material being laminated. If the laminated pouch is cloudy after the first pass through the machine, adjust the temperature to the next higher position and run it through again. If waviness occurs, reduce the temperature to the next lower position. Always allow sufficient time for the laminator temperature to adjust to the changes made to the settings. 4 When the laminator has reached the correct lamination temperature the countdown to ready will indicate “Ready” 0 minutes on the LCD display. 5 Centre the item to be laminated within the pouch left to right with the top edge against the sealed edge of the pouch (fig.2). 6 Insert the pouch with the sealed edge first into the machine (fig.3). 7 The laminated item will automatically exit at the rear of the machine. After the pouch has stopped moving, carefully remove from the machine and place on a cool flat surface for approximately one minute for cooling (fig.4). 8 If you are finished laminating push the power switch to turn the machine off.
