Digital Input/Output Terminal This Network Camera provides a general I/O terminal block with one digital input and one digital output device control. Software Installation When the hardware installation is complete, users can use the Installation Wizard program included in the product CDROM to find the location of the Network Camera. There may be many Network Cameras in the local network. Users can differentiate the Network Cameras with the serial number. The serial number is printed on the labels on the carton and the back of the Network Camera body. Please refer to the user’s manual for the Installation Wizard for more details. Once the installation is complete, the Administrator should proceed to the next section "Initial access to the Network Camera" for necessary checks and configurations. - 4 - www.4XEM.com
Initial Access to the Network Camera Check Network Settings The Network Camera can be connected either before or immediately after software installation onto the Local Area Network. The Administrator should complete the network settings on the configuration page, including the correct subnet mask and IP address of the gateway and the DNS Servers. Ask your network administrator or Internet service provider for the details. If any setting is entered incorrectly and you cannot proceed with setting up the Network Camera, restore the factory settings following the steps in the “Troubleshooting” chapter in the Appendix. Add Password to Prevent Unauthorized Access The default Administrator’s password is blank and the Network Camera initially will not ask for any password. The Administrator should immediately assign a new password as a matter of prudent security practice. Once the Administrator’s password is saved, the Network Camera will ask for the user’s name and password before each access. The Administrator can set up a maximum of twenty (20) user accounts. Each user can access the Network Camera except to perform system configuration. Some critical functions such as system configuration, user administration, and software upgrades are accessible only by the Administrator. The user name for the Administrator is permanently assigned as “root”. Once the password is changed, the browser will display an authentication window to ask for the new password. Once the password is set, there is no provision to recover the Administrator’s password. The only option is to restore to the original factory default settings. - 5 - www.4XEM.com
How to Use Installing Plug-in For the initial access to the Network Camera in Windows, the web browser may prompt for permission to install a new plug-in for the Network Camera. Permission request depends on the Internet security settings of the user’s PC or notebook. If the highest security level is set, the computer may prohibit any installation and execution attempt. This plug-in has been registered for certificate and is used to display the video in the browser. Users may click on proceed. If the web browser does not allow the user to continue to install, check the Internet security option and lower the security levels or contact your IT or networking supervisor for help. to - 6 - www.4XEM.com
Primary User’s Capability Main Screen with Camera View Snapshot : Opens a still picture of current view in new window. Client Settings : Configures local Browser settings. Configuration: Provides access to all camera configuration options. Camera View: Live streaming video. Digital Zoom Click on the magnifier icon under the camera view then the digital zoom control panel will be shown. Uncheck “Disable digital zoom” and use the slider control to change the zoom factors. - 7 - www.4XEM.com
Snapshot Click on Snapshot , web browser will pop up a new window to show the snapshot. Users can point at the snapshot and click the right mouse button to save it. Client Settings There are two settings for the client side: Media Options to determine the type of media to be streamed and Protocol Options which allows choice of connection protocol between client and server. There are two protocol choices to optimize your usage – UDP and TCP. - 8 - www.4XEM.com
The UDP protocol allows for more real-time audio and video streams. However, some packets may be lost due to network burst traffic and images may be obscured. The TCP protocol allows for less packet loss and produces a more accurate video display. The downside with this protocol is that the real-time effect is worse than that with the UDP protocol. If no special need is required, UDP protocol is recommended. Generally speaking, the client’s choice will be in the order of UDP – TCP. After the Network Camera is connected successfully, Protocol Option will indicate the selected protocol. The selected protocol will be recorded in the user's PC and will be used for the next connection. If the network environment is changed, or the user wants to let the web browser detect again, manually select the UDP protocol, save, and return HOME to re-connect. Digital Output Click on ON , the digital output of the Network Camera will be triggered. Or, clicking on OFF can let the digital output turn into normal state. - 9 - www.4XEM.com
Administrator’s Capability Fine-tuning for Best Performance Best performance generally equates to the fastest image refresh rate with the best video quality, and at the lowest network bandwidth as possible. The three factors, Maximum frame rate , Constant bit rate , and Fix quality on the Audio and Video Configuration page, correlate to allow for achieving the best performance possible. For Viewing by Mobile Phone Most 3GPP cell phone supports media streaming with MPEG4 video and GSM-AMR audio. Due to the limitation of the bandwidth for 3GPP, only 176x144 video solution will be supported for cell phone viewing. Select the Configure for mobile viewing option will change the range of other related video settings. - 10 - www.4XEM.com
For Best Real-time Video Images To achieve good real-time visual effect, the network bandwidth should be large enough to allow a transmission rate of greater than 20 image frames per second. If the broadband network is over 1 Mbps, set the Fix bit rate to 1000Kbps or 1200Kbps, and set Fix quality at the highest quality. The maximum frame rate is 30. If your network bandwidth is more than 512Kbps, you can fix the bit rate according to your bandwidth and set the maximum frame rate to 30 fps. If the images vary dramatically in your environment, you may want to slow the maximum frame rate down to 20 fps in order to lower the rate of data transmission. This allows for better video quality and the human eyes cannot readily detect the differences between 20, 25, or 30 frames per second. If your network bandwidth is below 512 Kbps, set the Fix bit rate according to your bandwidth and try to get the best performance by fine-tuning with the Maximum frame rate . In a slow network, greater frame rate results in blur images. Another work-around is to choose 160x120 in the Size option for better images. Video quality performance will vary somewhat due to the number of users viewing on the network, even when the parameters have initially been finely tuned. Performance will also suffer due to poor connectivity because of the network’s burst constraint. Only Quality Images Will Do To have the best video quality, you should set Fix quality at Detailed or Excellent and adjust the Maximum frame rate to match your network’s bandwidth. If your network is slow and you receive “broken” pictures, go to the TCP protocol in Connection type and choose a more appropriate mode of transmission. The images may suffer a time delay due to a slower connection. The delay will also increase with added number of users. Somewhere Between Real-time and Clear Images If you have a broadband network, set Fix quality at Normal or better, rather than setting Fix bit rate . You can also fix the bandwidth according to your actual network speed and adjust the frame rate. Start from 30 fps down for best results but not below 15 fps. If the image qualities are not improved, select a lower bandwidth setting. - 11 - www.4XEM.com

This system log contains important information about the configuration and connection of the camera after bootup. Remote logging is also possible on a Linux server with syslogd service running. Simply enter the IP Address and Port Number of the server to configure the remote logging option. Please note: your remote server must be RFC 3164 compliant. Check Enable remote log and input the IP address and port number of the log server to enable the remote log facility. Current log displays the current system log file. The content of the log provides useful information about configuration and connection after system boot-up. - 31 - www.4XEM.com
