Do not attempt to insert a disc into the unit when the unit power is off. Inserting Discs Your player accepts only one disc at a time for playback. Do not attempt to load more than one disc. Make sure the label side is facing up when you insert the disc. “ERROR” will be displayed on your player if you insert a disc incorrectly. If “ERROR” continues to be displayed even though the disc has been inserted correctly, push the RESET switch with a pointed object such as a ballpoint pen. Playing a disc while driving on a very bumpy road may result in skips, but this will not scratch the disc or damage the player. New Discs To prevent the CD from jamming, “ERROR” is displayed if discs with irregular surfaces are inserted or if discs are inserted incorrectly. When a new disc is ejected immediately after initial loading, use your finger to feel around the inside of the center hole and outside edge of the disc. If you feel any small bumps or irregularities, this could inhibit proper loading of the disc. To remove the bumps, rub the inside edge of the hole and outside edge of the disc with a ballpoint pen or other such instrument, then insert the disc again. Centre Hole Bumps Irregular Shaped Discs Be sure to use round shape discs only for this unit and never use any special shape discs.

About MP3/WMA CAUTION Except for private use, duplicating audio data (including MP3/ WMA data) or distributing, transferring, or copying it, whether for free or for a fee, without permission of the copyright holder is strictly prohibited by the Copyright Act and by international treaty. What is MP3? MP3, whose official name is “MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3,” is a compression standard prescribed by the ISO, the International Standardization Organization and MPEG which is a joint activity institution of the IEC. MP3 files contain compressed audio data. MP3 encoding is capable of compressing audio data at extremely high ratios, reducing the size of music files to as much as one-tenth their original size. This is achieved while still maintaining near CD quality. The MP3 format realizes such high compression ratios by eliminating the sounds that are either inaudible to the human ear or masked by other sounds. What is WMA? WMA, or “Windows Media™ Audio,” is compressed audio data. WMA is similar to MP3 audio data and can achieve CD quality sound with small file sizes. Method for creating MP3/WMA files Audio data is compressed by using MP3/WMA specified software. For details on creating MP3/WMA files, refer to the user’s manual for that software. MP3/WMA files that can be played back by this device have the file extension “mp3” / “wma”. Files with no extension cannot be played back. (WMA ver. 7.1, 8 and 9 are supported) ALPINE CDE-9850Ri 68-04123Z56-A (EN) 13 -EN

This device may not play back correctly depending on sampling rates. ID3 tags/WMA tags This device supports ID3 tag v1 and v2, and WMA tag. If tag data is in an MP3/WMA file, this device can display the title (track title), artist name, and album name ID3 tag/WMA tag data. This device can only display single-byte alphanumeric characters (up to 30 for ID3 tags and up to 15 for WMA tags) and the underscore. For non-supported characters, “NO SUPPORT” is displayed. The tag information may not be correctly displayed, depending on the contents. Producing MP3/WMA discs MP3/WMA files are prepared, then written to a CD-R or CD-RW using CD-R writing software. A disc can hold up to 510 files/ folders (including Root Folders). However, the maximum number of folders is 255. Media supported The media that this device can play back are CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and CD-RWs. Corresponding File Systems This device supports discs formatted with ISO9660 Level 1 or Level 2. Under the ISO9660 standard, there are some restrictions to remember. The maximum nested folder depth is 8 (including the root directory). The number of characters for a folder/file name is limited. Valid characters for folder/file names are letters A-Z (all caps), numbers 0-9, and ‘_’ (underscore). This device also can play back discs in Joliet, Romeo, etc., and other standards that conform to ISO9660. However, sometimes the file names, folder names, etc., are not displayed correctly. Formats supported This device supports CD-ROM XA, Mixed Mode CD, Enhanced CD (CD-Extra) and Multi-Session.

Therefore, the playing order may not be the same as the order you input. The playback order of the folders and files is as follows. However, the folder and file playback order differs from the folder and file number indicated on the display. Root folder Folder MP3/WMA File Terminology Bit rate This is the “sound” compression rate specified for encoding. The higher the bit rate, the higher the sound quality, but also the larger the files. Sampling rate This value shows how many times per second the data is sampled (recorded). For example, music CDs use a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, so the sound is sampled (recorded) 44,100 times per second. The higher the sampling rate, the higher the sound quality, but also the larger the volume of data. Encoding Converting music CDs, WAVE (AIFF) files, and other sound files into the specified audio compression format. Tag Song information such as track titles, artist names, album names, etc., written into MP3/WMA files. MP3: ID3 tag WMA: WMA tag Root folder The root folder is found at the top of the file system.

Warning MAKE THE CORRECT CONNECTIONS. Failure to make the proper connections may result in fire or product damage. USE ONLY IN CARS WITH A 12 VOLT NEGATIVE GROUND. (Check with your dealer if you are not sure.) Failure to do so may result in fire, etc. BEFORE WIRING, DISCONNECT THE CABLE FROM THE NEGATIVE BATTERY TERMINAL. Failure to do so may result in electric shock or injury due to electrical shorts. DO NOT SPLICE INTO ELECTRICAL CABLES. Never cut away cable insulation to supply power to other equipment. Doing so will exceed the current carrying capacity of the wire and result in fire or electric shock. DO NOT DAMAGE PIPE OR WIRING WHEN DRILLING HOLES. When drilling holes in the chassis for installation, take precautions so as not to contact, damage or obstruct pipes, fuel lines, tanks or electrical wiring. Failure to take such precautions may result in fire. DO NOT USE BOLTS OR NUTS IN THE BRAKE OR STEERING SYSTEMS TO MAKE GROUND CONNECTIONS. Bolts or nuts used for the brake or steering systems (or any other safety-related system), or tanks should NEVER be used for installations or ground connections. Using such parts could disable control of the vehicle and cause fire etc. KEEP SMALL OBJECTS SUCH AS BATTERIES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. Swallowing them may result in serious injury. If swallowed, consult a physician immediately. DO NOT INSTALL IN LOCATIONS WHICH MIGHT HINDER VEHICLE OPERATION, SUCH AS THE STEERING WHEEL OR SHIFT LEVER. Doing so may obstruct forward vision or hamper movement etc. and results in serious accident.

About MP3/WMA CAUTION Except for private use, duplicating audio data (including MP3/ WMA data) or distributing, transferring, or copying it, whether for free or for a fee, without permission of the copyright holder is strictly prohibited by the Copyright Act and by international treaty. What is MP3? MP3, whose official name is “MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3,” is a compression standard prescribed by the ISO, the International Standardization Organization and MPEG which is a joint activity institution of the IEC. MP3 files contain compressed audio data. MP3 encoding is capable of compressing audio data at extremely high ratios, reducing the size of music files to as much as one-tenth their original size. This is achieved while still maintaining near CD quality. The MP3 format realizes such high compression ratios by eliminating the sounds that are either inaudible to the human ear or masked by other sounds. What is WMA? WMA, or “Windows Media™ Audio,” is compressed audio data. WMA is similar to MP3 audio data and can achieve CD quality sound with small file sizes. Method for creating MP3/WMA files Audio data is compressed by using MP3/WMA specified software. For details on creating MP3/WMA files, refer to the user’s manual for that software. MP3/WMA files that can be played back by this device have the file extension “mp3” / “wma”. Files with no extension cannot be played back.

The tag information may not be correctly displayed, depending on the contents. Producing MP3/WMA discs MP3/WMA files are prepared, then written to a CD-R or CD-RW using CD-R writing software. A disc can hold up to 510 files/ folders (including Root Folders). However, the maximum number of folders is 255. Media supported The media that this device can play back are CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and CD-RWs. Corresponding File Systems This device supports discs formatted with ISO9660 Level 1 or Level 2. Under the ISO9660 standard, there are some restrictions to remember. The maximum nested folder depth is 8 (including the root directory). The number of characters for a folder/file name is limited. Valid characters for folder/file names are letters A-Z (all caps), numbers 0-9, and ‘_’ (underscore). This device also can play back discs in Joliet, Romeo, etc., and other standards that conform to ISO9660. However, sometimes the file names, folder names, etc., are not displayed correctly.

However, the folder and file playback order differs from the folder and file number indicated on the display. Root folder Folder MP3/WMA File Terminology Bit rate This is the “sound” compression rate specified for encoding. The higher the bit rate, the higher the sound quality, but also the larger the files. Sampling rate This value shows how many times per second the data is sampled (recorded). For example, music CDs use a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, so the sound is sampled (recorded) 44,100 times per second. The higher the sampling rate, the higher the sound quality, but also the larger the volume of data. Encoding Converting music CDs, WAVE (AIFF) files, and other sound files into the specified audio compression format.

Warning MAKE THE CORRECT CONNECTIONS. Failure to make the proper connections may result in fire or product damage. USE ONLY IN CARS WITH A 12 VOLT NEGATIVE GROUND. (Check with your dealer if you are not sure.) Failure to do so may result in fire, etc. BEFORE WIRING, DISCONNECT THE CABLE FROM THE NEGATIVE BATTERY TERMINAL. Failure to do so may result in electric shock or injury due to electrical shorts. DO NOT SPLICE INTO ELECTRICAL CABLES. Never cut away cable insulation to supply power to other equipment. Doing so will exceed the current carrying capacity of the wire and result in fire or electric shock. DO NOT DAMAGE PIPE OR WIRING WHEN DRILLING HOLES. When drilling holes in the chassis for installation, take precautions so as not to contact, damage or obstruct pipes, fuel lines, tanks or electrical wiring. Failure to take such precautions may result in fire. DO NOT USE BOLTS OR NUTS IN THE BRAKE OR STEERING SYSTEMS TO MAKE GROUND CONNECTIONS. Bolts or nuts used for the brake or steering systems (or any other safety-related system), or tanks should NEVER be used for installations or ground connections. Using such parts could disable control of the vehicle and cause fire etc. KEEP SMALL OBJECTS SUCH AS BATTERIES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. Swallowing them may result in serious injury. If swallowed, consult a physician immediately. DO NOT INSTALL IN LOCATIONS WHICH MIGHT HINDER VEHICLE OPERATION, SUCH AS THE STEERING WHEEL OR SHIFT LEVER.
