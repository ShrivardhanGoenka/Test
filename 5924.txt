DESCRIPTION: The GHV-DES/A is an audio/video entrance station for the GH Multi-Unit entry system. This unit is equipped with an audio module for communication, a camera module for video, a 10-key pad for direct digital dialing, and a VFD display for a greeting message, tenant names and numbers, and system status. The GHV-DES/A works on a common bus wiring system, carrying the calling and communication functions on a 2 conductor wire, and the video signal on a second 2 conductor wire. A separate power supply provides voltage to the digital display, while the power for the audio and video is supplied on the common bus wires. The entrance station is designed to be semi-flush mount, and has an optional rain hood or hooded surface mount box to be used as necessary. Audio and video entrance panels are intermixable within a system. Audio and video tenant stations are intermixable, allowing up to two video stations and two audio stations to be used in the same tenant location. Communication is hands free at the entrance station when a tenant answers the call, and is either VOX hands free or push-to-talk at the tenant station when speaking with the visitor.
