730sg-1.book Page 2 Wednesday, December 1, 1999 6:03 PM Display The large graphics display offers excellent viewing, display quality and desktop performance graphics. The computer supports a Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) displaying 24-bit high-color at 1024x768 Extended Graphic Array (XGA) resolution. Video performance 2X AGP video graphic accelerator with 8 MB of video memory boost video performance. Simultaneous display The computer’s large display and multimedia capabilities are great for giving presentations. If you prefer, you can also connect an external monitor when giving presentations. This computer supports simultaneous LCD and CRT display. Simultaneous display allows you to control the presentation from your computer and at the same time face your audience. You can also connect other output display devices such as LCD projection panels for large-audience presentations. Dual Display The computer’s unique graphics chip takes advantage of Windows 98’s multi-display capability, allowing you to extend your desktop to an external display device, such as an external monitor projector. With this feature enabled, you can move program windows to/from the computer LCD and the external monitor. Power management The power management system incorporates an "automatic LCD dim" feature that automatically dims the LCD when the computer is powered by a battery pack to conserve battery power. See “Power Management” on page 20 for more information on power management features. Opening and closing the display To open the display, slide the display cover latch to the left and lift up the cover. Then tilt it to a comfortable viewing position. The computer employs a microswitch that turns off the display (and enters standby mode) to conserve power when you close the display cover, and turns it back on when you open the display cover. NOTE: If an external monitor is connected, the computer turns off the display (but does not enter standby mode) when you close the display cover. To close the display cover, fold it down gently until the display cover latch clicks into place. WARNING: To avoid damaging the display, do not slam it when you close it. Also, do not place any object on top of the computer when the display is closed. 2 Chapter 1

Connect the power adapter and check that power is supplied. 3. Disconnect the power adapter and install the charged battery pack; then check that power is supplied by the battery pack. If you suspect a power problem, see the appropriate power supply check in the following list: “Check the Power Adapter” on page 59 T “Check the Battery Pack” on page 60 T Check the Power Adapter Unplug the power adapter cable from the computer and measure the output voltage at the plug of the power adapter cable. See the following figure 1. If the voltage is not correct, replace the power adapter. 2. If the voltage is within the range, do the following: Replace the System board. T If the problem is not corrected, see “Undetermined Problems” on page 68. T If the voltage is not correct, go to the next step. T NOTE: An audible noise from the power adapter does not always indicate a defect. 3. If the power-on indicator does not light up, check the power cord of the power adapter for correct continuity and installation. 4. If the operational charge does not work, see “Check the Battery Pack” on page 60. Chapter 4 59 Pin 1: +19 to +20.5V Pin 2: 0V, Ground
730sg-1.book Page 60 Wednesday, December 1, 1999 6:03 PM Check the Battery Pack To check the battery pack, do the following: From Software: 1. Check out the Power Management in control Panel 2. In Power Meter, confirm that if the parameters shown in the screen for Current Power Source and Total Battery Power Remaining are correct. 3. Repeat the steps 1 and 2, for both battery and adapter. 4. This helps you identify first the problem is on recharging or discharging. From Hardware: 1. Power off the computer. 2. Remove the battery pack and measure the voltage between battery terminals 1(+) and 6(ground). See the following figure 3. If the voltage is still less than 7.5 Vdc after recharging, replace the battery. To check the battery charge operation, use a discharged battery pack or a battery pack that has less than 50% of the total power remaining when installed in the computer. If the battery status indicator does not light up, remove the battery pack and let it return to room temperature. Re-install the battery pack. If the charge indicator still does not light up, replace the battery pack. If the charge indicator still does not light up, replace the DC/DC charger board. Touchpad Check If the touchpad doesn’t work, do the following actions one at a time to correct the problem. Do not replace a non-defective FRU: 1. Reconnect the touchpad cables. 2. Replace the touchpad. 3. Replace the system board. After you use the touchpad, the pointer drifts on the screen for a short time. This self-acting pointer movement can occur when a slight, steady pressure is applied to the touchpad pointer. This symptom is not a hardware problem. No service actions are necessary if the pointer movement stops in a short period of time. 60 Chapter 4
730sg-1.book Page 61 Wednesday, December 1, 1999 6:03 PM Power-On Self-Test (POST) Error Message The POST error message index lists the error message and their possible causes. The most likely cause is listed first. NOTE: Perform the FRU replacement or actions in the sequence shown in FRU/Action column, if the FRU replacement does not solve the problem, put the original part back in the computer. Do not replace a non-defective FRU. This index can also help you determine the next possible FRU to be replaced when servicing a computer. If the symptom is not listed, see “Undetermined Problems” on page 68. The following lists the error messages that the BIOS displays on the screen and the error symptoms classified by function. NOTE: Most of the error messages occur during POST. Some of them display information about a hardware device, e.g., the amount of memory installed. Others may indicate a problem with a device, such as the way it has been configured. NOTE: If the system fails after you make changes in the BIOS Setup Utility menus, reset the computer, enter Setup and install Setup defaults or correct the error. Chapter 4 61
730sg-1.book Page 67 Wednesday, December 1, 1999 6:03 PM Intermittent Problems Intermittent system hang problems can be caused by a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with a hardware defect, such as: cosmic radiation, electrostatic discharge, or software errors. FRU replacement should be considered only when a recurring problem exists. When analyzing an intermittent problem, do the following: 1. Run the advanced diagnostic test for the system board in loop mode at least 10 times. 2. If no error is detected, do not replace any FRU. 3. If any error is detected, replace the FRU. Rerun the test to verify that there are no more errors. Chapter 4 67
730sg-1.book Page 68 Wednesday, December 1, 1999 6:03 PM Undetermined Problems The diagnostic problems does not identify which adapter or device failed, which installed devices are incorrect, whether a short circuit is suspected, or whether the system is inoperative. Follow these procedures to isolate the failing FRU (do not isolate non-defective FRU). NOTE: Verify that all attached devices are supported by the computer. NOTE: Verify that the power supply being used at the time of the failure is operating correctly. (See “Power System Check” on page 59): 1. Power-off the computer. 2. Visually check them for damage. If any problems are found, replace the FRU. 3. Remove or disconnect all of the following devices: Non-Acer devices T Printer, mouse, and other external devices T Battery pack T Hard disk drive T DIMM T CD-ROM/Diskette drive Module T PC Cards T 4. Power-on the computer. 5. Determine if the problem has changed. 6. If the problem does not recur, reconnect the removed devices one at a time until you find the failing FRU. 7. If the problem remains, replace the following FRU one at a time. Do not replace a non-defective FRU: System board T LCD assembly T 68 Chapter 4
