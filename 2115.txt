CHIME REPLACEMENT INSTALLATION IMPORTANT: Proper installation requires a diode on the front door push button. See Diode Installation Instructions (page 5) after completing steps 1 through 10 below. Note: Electrical work must be in accordance with national and local electrical codes. If in doubt, consult a qualiﬁed electrician. 1. Verify transformer power rating. Power must be supplied from a 16 Volt AC, 10 Watt or a 16 Volt AC, 15 Watt transformer. 2. Remove cover from existing chime. 3. Label all wires before disconnecting. Using masking tape, mark each wire according to existing chime terminal markings. “F” – Front Push Button Wire “T” – Transformer Wire “R” – Rear Push Button Wire* 4. Disconnect all wires from existing chime. 5. Remove existing chime base from wall. 6. Determine proper chime base orientation. The chime cover style will determine orientation. 7. Determine cover mounting type. For hanging type covers, cover pin should be exposed (see Figures 1 and 3). -2- 598-1224-00 Cover Pin (Used for Hanging Type Covers) Volume Control Front Door Tune Selection Switch (On Select Models) “A” - Westminster “B” - Whittington Transformer and Push Button Wire Connections Figure 1 - Electronic Chime Identiﬁcation (TR-0070-BX Base Shown) Illustrations may vary from actual chime unit.

8. Route wires through wire entrance hole in new chime base. 9. Mount chime base to wall using screws and anchors provided. (Drill 7/32" diameter pilot hole for wall anchors.) 10. Connect wire “F” to screw terminal marked “FRONT”. Connect wire “T” to screw terminal marked “TRANS”. Connect wire “R” to screw terminal marked “REAR”* (See Figure 2). 11. Install chime cover (see page 4). 12. Connect diode to front push button (see page 5). * Note: Some installations may not include rear door push button.

INSTALL CHIME COVER Place chime cover securely over base. For hanging type cover: Remove, turn over, and reinstall the cover pin (see Figure 3). Hang cover on cover pin. For snap-on type cover: Apply pressure to the cover until it snaps into place (see Figure 4). Firmly grasp cover and pull to remove from base. Note: Never use cleaners or polishes. Never use any ﬂuids on the electronic chime mechanism. Use dry cloth to clean chime cover and base. -4- 598-1224-00 Cover Pin Figure 3 - Turning Over Cover Pin for Hanging Type Cover Base Orientation Snap-On Cover Marking Illustrations may vary from actual chime unit.

DIODE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS A small electrical component called a “diode” is required for this chime to play the entire eight-note tune. This diode must be installed on the terminal screws of the front door push button (see Figure 5). If not already installed on push button, attach supplied diode as shown below. If, with the diode in place, the chime does not play the complete eight-note melody, see Troubleshooting, page 6.

Chime does not sound: Check Chime: Disconnect wire from terminal marked “TRANS”. Have someone operate push button at front door while you mo- mentarily touch the “TRANS” wire to terminal marked “FRONT”. You will see a small spark if push button, wiring, and transformer are operating properly. Repeat the steps for “REAR” terminal and rear push button. If wiring between transformer and push button(s) check out properly, replace chime. Check Transformer: Test transformer voltage output with a volt meter. If a volt meter is not available, momentarily touch the two low-voltage terminals with a screwdriver. You will see a small spark if transformer is operating properly. If no spark is evident, replace transformer. Check Push Button(s): Remove suspected push button from door frame, disconnect wire from terminals and touch bare wires together. If chime operates, push button is defective. Replace push button. Chime sounds but does not complete Westminster or Whittington (if applicable) tune: Check Diode on Front Push Button: Verify diode is attached securely to push button (see page 5). Chime may not function properly if a diode is installed on more than one push button. Note: Some push buttons have pre-installed diodes. An additional diode should not be added if the push button has a pre-installed diode. If eight-note tune still does not sound completely, replace diode (Type 1N4001-50V-1A, available at local electrical component supplier). TROUBLESHOOTING -6- 598-1224-00
