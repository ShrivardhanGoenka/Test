Any power equipment can cause injury if operated improperly or if the user does not understand how to operate the equipment. Exercise caution at all times when operating equipment. Read the towing vehicle owners manual and towing vehicle safety rules. Know how to operate your tractor before using the broadcast spreader attachment. Read the chemical label instructions and cautions for handling and applying the chemicals purchased for spreading. Wear eye and hand protection when handling and when applying lawn or garden chemicals. Never operate tractor and spreader attachment without wearing substantial footwear, and do not allow anyone to ride or sit on spreader attachment frame. Follow maintenance and lubrication instructions as outlined in this manual.

IT MEANS — ATTENTION! BECOME ALERT! YOuR SAFETY IS INVOLVED. 7 11 10 13 9 Always	begin	with	the	transmission	in	first	(low)	gear	and with the engine at low speed, and gradually increase speed as conditions permit. When towing broadcast spreader do not drive too close to a creek or ditch and be alert for holes and other hazards which could cause you to loose control of the broadcast spreader and tractor. Before operating vehicle on any grade (hill) refer to the safety rules in the vehicle owner's manual concerning safe operation on slopes. Stay off steep slopes! Never allow children to operate the tractor or spreader attachment, and do not allow adults to operate without proper instructions. 2 4 3 5 8 12 8 Control Tube 9 RH Wheel 10 LH Wheel 11 Flow Control Arm 1 Top Hitch (tall) 13 Bottom Hitch (short) 14 Reinforcement Strap  14

TIGHTEN FASTENERS FIGuRE 11 CALIBRATING FLOW CONTROL ARM Flow control mounting bracket (figure 16 and 17) a. Set	adjustable	stop	at	"OFF"	position.	Move	flow	control arm against adjustable stop. b. Slide	flow	control	mounting	bracket	along	control	tube until closure plate in bottom of hopper just closes. c. Snug	the	nuts	just	enough	to	hold	flow	control	mounting bracket in place. d. Set	adjustable	stop	at	"5".	With	flow	control	arm	resting against stop, verify that closure plate is open about half way. e. If	closure	plate	is	not	open	about	half	way,	slide	flow control mounting bracket up or down control tube until closure plate will open about half way at "5" and will close completely when arm is pushed past adjustable stop to "OFF" position. Tighten the 5/16" nylock hex nuts. FIGuRE 16 FIGuRE 17 Tighten the nut (H) and then loosen just	enough	that	the	flow	control	arm moves freely. "OFF" OPERATION HOW TO uSE YOuR SPREADER SETTING THE FLOW CONTROL (Refer	to	figure	16	and	17) 1. Loosen the nylon wing nut, set the adjustable stop to the	desired	flow	rate	setting	and	retighten	the	wing	nut. The higher the setting number, the wider the opening in the bottom of the hopper. . Refer to the Application Chart on page 8 and to the instructions on the fertilizer bag to select the proper flow	rate	setting. 3. Pull	the	flow	control	arm	from	the	"OFF"	position	and rest it against the adjustable stop for the “ON” position. Push	the	flow	control	arm	past	the	stop,	toward	the hopper for the “OFF” position. uSING THE PATTERN ADJuSTMENT PLATE The pattern adjustment plate is used to adjust the flow of material being spread to the left or right side. The pattern adjustment plate is the bottom stainless steel plate underneath the hopper. The adjustment of the pattern plate is sensitive. It is recommended that you test your spread pattern in a small area	first. 1. To	adjust	the	flow	to	be	heavier	to	the	left	side,	tighten the thumbscrew so the plate will not pull out as far. See	figure	18. 2. To adjust the flow to be heavier to the right side, loosen the thumbscrew so the plate will pull out farther. See	figure	18. "5" FIGuRE 18 7 THUMB SCREW
uSING YOuR SPREADER The use of powdered lawn chemicals is not recommended, due to difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory or consistent broadcast pattern. 1. Determine approximate square footage of area to be covered and estimate amount of material required. 2. Before	filling	the	hopper,	set	the	adjustable	stop	to	the proper setting. Refer to the Application Chart on this page and to the instructions on the fertilizer bag to select the proper	flow	rate	setting. 3. Move	the	flow	control	arm	past	the	adjustable	stop	to	the “OFF” position so that the closure plate is shut. 4. Fill the hopper, breaking up any lumpy fertilizer. 5. The Application Chart is calculated for light-to-heavy application at a walking speed of 3 mph, or 100 ft. in 3 seconds. A variation in speed will require an adjustment of	the	flow	rate	to	maintain	the	same	coverage.	The	faster you travel, the wider the broadcast width. 6. Always start the spreader in motion before opening the closure plate. 7. Always shut the closure plate before turning or stopping the spreader. 8. If fertilizer is accidentally deposited too heavily in a small area, soak the area thoroughly with a garden hose or sprinkler to prevent burning of the lawn. 9. To insure uniform coverage, make each pass so that the broadcast pattern slightly overlaps the pattern from the previous	pass	as	shown	in	figure	19.	The	approximate broadcast widths for different materials are shown in the Application Diagram figure	19. 10. When broadcasting weed control fertilizers, make sure the broadcast	pattern	does	not	hit	evergreen	trees,	flowers or shrubs. REFER TO CHARTS OVERLAP FIGuRE 19 IMPORTANT: Application rates shown in the chart are affected by humidity and by the moisture content of the material (granular and pellet). Some minor setting adjustments may be necessary to compensate for this condition. MATERIAL TYPE FERTILIZER Powder Granular Pelleted Organic GRASS SEED Fine Coarse ICE MELTER OPERATING SPEED - 3 MPH.

MAINTENANCE CHECK FOR LOOSE FASTENERS 1. Before each use, make a thorough visual check of the spreader for any bolts and nuts which may have loosened. Retighten any loose bolts and nuts. CHECK FOR WORN OR DAMAGED PARTS . Check for worn or damaged parts before each use. Repair or replace parts if necessary. CHECK TIRE INFLATION 3. Check	if	tires	are	adequately	inflated	before	each	use. Do not inflate tires beyond maximum recommended pressure. CAuTION: DO NOT inflate	tires	beyond	the maximum recommended pressure printed on side of tire. CLEANING 4. Rinse inside of hopper and exterior of spreader and allow to dry before storing. LuBRICATE (See	figure	20) 5. Remove one small and two large hairpins and separate the gearbox housings. 6. Lightly apply automotive grease as needed to the gears. 7. Oil the nylon bushings on the vertical sprocket shaft. Apply grease to the axle at least once a year, or more often as needed. 8. Oil (idler) wheel at least once a year or more often as needed. 9. Install gearbox housings and secure with hairpins. OIL FIGuRE 20 STORAGE 1. Rinse inside of hopper and exterior of spreader and allow to dry before storing. . Store in a clean, dry area. SERVICE AND ADJuSTMENTS 1. If the axle and gear assembly is disassembled, mark down the positions of the parts as they are removed. The large gear position in relation to the small gear determines which direction the spreader plate will spin. Be sure to reassemble them in their original positions. (Refer to parts exploded view on page 10). Ensure washer (Refer to item 33 on page 10 and 11) is in place when assembling the axle components. Add grease to gears. . If the agitator hairpin becomes damaged or worn, it can be replaced. Remove old agitator hairpin from hole in impeller shaft and replace with new agitator hairpin.	See	figure	21.
