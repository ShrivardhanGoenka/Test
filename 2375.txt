See if CD-ROM Test is passed when the program runs to CD-ROM Test. 3. Follow the instructions in the message window. If an error occurs, reconnect the connector on the System board. If the error still remains: 1. Reconnect the external diskette drive/CD-ROM module. 2. Replace the external diskette drive/CD-ROM module. 3. Replace the main board. Keyboard or Auxiliary Input Device Check Remove the external keyboard if the internal keyboard is to be tested. If the internal keyboard does not work or an unexpected character appears, make sure that the flexible cable extending from the keyboard is correctly seated in the connector on the system board. If the keyboard cable connection is correct, run the Keyboard Test. If the tests detect a keyboard problem, do the following one at a time to correct the problem. Do not replace a non-defective FRU: 1. Reconnect the keyboard cables. 2. Replace the keyboard. 3. Replace the main board. The following auxiliary input devices are supported by this computer: Numeric keypad � External keyboard � 66 Chapter 4
If any of these devices do not work, reconnect the cable connector and repeat the failing operation. Memory check Memory errors might stop system operations, show error messages on the screen, or hang the system. 1. Boot from the diagnostics diskette and start the doagmpstotics program (please refer to main board. 2. Go to the diagnostic memory in the test items. 3. Press F2 in the test items. 4. Follow the instructions in the message window. NOTE: Make sure that the DIMM is fully installed into the connector. A loose connection can cause an error. Power System Check To verify the symptom of the problem, power on the computer using each of the following power sources: 1. Remove the battery pack. 2. Connect the power adapter and check that power is supplied. 3. Disconnect the power adapter and install the charged battery pack; then check that power is supplied by the battery pack. If you suspect a power problem, see the appropriate power supply check in the following list: “Check the Power Adapter” on page 68 � “Check the Battery Pack” on page 69 � Chapter 4 67
Check the Power Adapter Unplug the power adapter cable from the computer and measure the output voltage at the plug of the power adapter cable. See the following figure 1. If the voltage is not correct, replace the power adapter. 2. If the voltage is within the range, do the following: Replace the System board. � If the problem is not corrected, see “Undetermined Problems” on page 82. � If the voltage is not correct, go to the next step. � NOTE: An audible noise from the power adapter does not always indicate a defect. 3. If the power-on indicator does not light up, check the power cord of the power adapter for correct continuity and installation. 4. If the operational charge does not work, see “Check the Battery Pack” on page 69. 68 Chapter 4 Pin 1: +19 to +20.5V Pin 2: 0V, Ground
Check the Battery Pack To check the battery pack, do the following: From Software: 1. Check out the Power Management in control Panel 2. In Power Meter, confirm that if the parameters shown in the screen for Current Power Source and Total Battery Power Remaining are correct. 3. Repeat the steps 1 and 2, for both battery and adapter. 4. This helps you identify first the problem is on recharging or discharging. From Hardware: 1. Power off the computer. 2. Remove the battery pack and measure the voltage between battery terminals 1(+) and 6(ground). See the following figure 3. If the voltage is still less than 7.5 Vdc after recharging, replace the battery. To check the battery charge operation, use a discharged battery pack or a battery pack that has less than 50% of the total power remaining when installed in the computer. If the battery status indicator does not light up, remove the battery pack and let it return to room temperature. Re-install the battery pack. If the charge indicator still does not light up, replace the battery pack. If the charge indicator still does not light up, replace the DC/DC charger board. Touchpad Check If the touchpad doesn’t work, do the following actions one at a time to correct the problem. Do not replace a non-defective FRU: 1. Reconnect the touchpad cables. 2. Replace the touchpad. 3. Replace the system board. After you use the touchpad, the pointer drifts on the screen for a short time. This self-acting pointer movement can occur when a slight, steady pressure is applied to the touchpad pointer. This symptom is not a hardware problem. No service actions are necessary if the pointer movement stops in a short period of time. Chapter 4 69
Power-On Self-Test (POST) Error Message The POST error message index lists the error message and their possible causes. The most likely cause is listed first. NOTE: Perform the FRU replacement or actions in the sequence shown in FRU/Action column, if the FRU replacement does not solve the problem, put the original part back in the computer. Do not replace a non-defective FRU. This index can also help you determine the next possible FRU to be replaced when servicing a computer. If the symptom is not listed, see “Undetermined Problems” on page 82. The following lists the error messages that the BIOS displays on the screen and the error symptoms classified by function. NOTE: Most of the error messages occur during POST. Some of them display information about a hardware device, e.g., the amount of memory installed. Others may indicate a problem with a device, such as the way it has been configured. NOTE: If the system fails after you make changes in the BIOS Setup Utility menus, reset the computer, enter Setup and install Setup defaults or correct the error. 70 Chapter 4

Intermittent Problems Intermittent system hang problems can be caused by a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with a hardware defect, such as: cosmic radiation, electrostatic discharge, or software errors. FRU replacement should be considered only when a recurring problem exists. When analyzing an intermittent problem, do the following: 1. Run the advanced diagnostic test for the system board in loop mode at least 10 times. 2. If no error is detected, do not replace any FRU. 3. If any error is detected, replace the FRU. Rerun the test to verify that there are no more errors. Chapter 4 81
Undetermined Problems The diagnostic problems does not identify which adapter or device failed, which installed devices are incorrect, whether a short circuit is suspected, or whether the system is inoperative. Follow these procedures to isolate the failing FRU (do not isolate non-defective FRU). NOTE: Verify that all attached devices are supported by the computer. NOTE: Verify that the power supply being used at the time of the failure is operating correctly. (See “Power System Check” on page 67.): 1. Power-off the computer. 2. Visually check them for damage. If any problems are found, replace the FRU. 3. Remove or disconnect all of the following devices: 4. Power-on the computer. 5. Determine if the problem has changed. 6. If the problem does not recur, reconnect the removed devices one at a time until you find the failing FRU. 7. If the problem remains, replace the following FRU one at a time. Do not replace a non-defective FRU: 82 Chapter 4 Non-Acer devices � Printer, mouse, and other external devices � Battery pack � Hard disk drive � DIMM � CD-ROM/Diskette drive Module � PC Cards � System board � LCD assembly �
